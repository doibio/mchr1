The purpose of the sentence is to explain the development of high-throughput in vitro assays that are used to measure secondary messenger pathways and protein-protein interactions. These assays allow researchers to quantify the potency, efficacy, and cooperativity of ligands.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to explain that the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in GPCRs is not equal and depends on the specific ligand that binds to the receptor. This concept is commonly known as ligand bias.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to introduce and highlight the two major pathways of focus in the field of GPCR pharmacology, namely the G protein pathway and the βarrestin pathway.
-----
The purpose of the sentence "In some cases, these pathways are activated equally in which case the compound is called an unbiased agonist" in this thesis is to explain that there are compounds that can activate both G protein- and βarrestin-mediated signaling pathways equally, and these compounds are referred to as unbiased agonists.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to provide an example of 5-HT2AR agonists, specifically lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ergotamine, and to highlight that these agonists activate βarrestin recruitment with greater potency and efficacy than Gq. This information establishes that LSD and ergotamine are considered to be βarrestin biased agonists.

The purpose of the sentence "An important consideration in GPCR pharmacology also pertains to the site at which a ligand binds to the GPCR" in this thesis is to highlight the significance of the binding site of a ligand on a GPCR in the field of GPCR pharmacology.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to provide information about the binding site for the conserved endogenous ligand of any GPCR, which is called the orthosteric binding site.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to provide information about the endogenous ligand for CB1R, which is 2-arachidonlyglycerol (2-AG), and to introduce the concept of allosteric binding sites on GPCRs.
-----
The purpose of the sentence "The most notable allosteric ligand amongst all GPCRs is cholesterol" in this thesis is to provide information about the role of cholesterol as an allosteric ligand in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to highlight the advantages of allosteric ligands over orthosteric ligands, specifically their greater receptor subtype selectivity and limited dependence, tolerance, or abuse liability.
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to describe the ability of the mentioned ligands to promote endogenous receptor activation, but not direct activation compared to an orthosteric ligand.
-----
The purpose of the sentence "Allosteric modulators may be positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) or negative allosteric modulators (NAMs)" is to provide a definition and classification of allosteric modulators. It explains that allosteric modulators can have two different types of effects: positive allosteric modulation (PAM) and negative allosteric modulation (NAM).
-----
The purpose of the sentence is to explain the different effects of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) on the primary ligand. It states that a PAM can enhance the affinity, potency, and/or efficacy of the primary ligand, while a NAM can reduce the affinity, potency, and/or efficacy of the primary ligand.
