Chapter 3 comments

* TODO
General comment: Add footnotes with urls for all the programming stuff (
ruby, python, phonegap etc)

* DONE 
General comment: I think you need to restucture and rename the chapters as
follows:

Chapter 3 Orchive Software Design and Architecture

Merge chapter 4 into this

Chapter 4 Automatic and Semi-Automatic Analysis

Move all the feature descriptions and machine learning
stuff from Chapter 5

Chapter 5 Evaluation

* DONE 
of 44100 samples/sec means  -> this means

* DONE 
Firstly that it allowed -> Firstly it should allow

* DONE 
was that it allows -> was that is should allow

* DONE 
where regions where orca were vocalizing -> the regions where orcas were 
vocalizing

* DONE 
3.1 Choice of Platform -> 3.1 Design Considerations

* DONE 
  were precalculated using Marsyas and were stored on the server at a 
number of different zoom levels
-> I think that so far you have not mentioned Marsyas so you should a 
short sentence
(and citation) explaining what it is

* DONE 
3,900 people who have viewed the site with over 10,000 individual visits 
-> that's incredible
I did not know that

* DONE 
was begun from scratch. -> was started from scratch ?

* TODO
In order to improve latency, the Javascript interface sends multiple 
requests for rect- angular sections of the visible spectrogram, which 
allows multiple cores on the server to generate spectrograms in 
parallel. In addition, these spectrograms are cached in memory on the 
server (using memcached) to speed subsequent requests for the same 
region of a spectrogram.
-> it would be nice if possible to add a small figure or table showing 
speedup from doing single core generation of spectrogram vs multiple cores

* DONE 
from Labeling  -> from labeling

* DONE 
For my evaluation -> For the evaluation

* DONE 
The first set of tools are audio feature extraction tools that have been 
adapted from the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) [FD02] to 
the study of orca vocalizations. -> incomplete sentence

* DONE 
Section 3.6
The first two paragraphs are essentially repeats of things you have 
talked about before.

* DONE 
You need a summary section, summarizing the findings and connecting
to the rest of the thesis
