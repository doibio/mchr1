Overall it reads well and is in good shape but needs some polishing.
Specific details below.

The Orchive : A system for semi-automatic annotation and analysis of a 
large collection of bioacoustic recordings.

* TODO
Abstract
(too many uses of system - try to reduce)

* DONE 
have allowed for the collection -> have enabled the collection

* DONE 
when large collections -> when processing large collections

* DONE 
system to allow -> system that assists

* DONE 
and annotate these collections. -> and annotate these collections is
proposed.

* DONE 
provides functionality to allow for the -> supports semi-automatic

* DONE 
machine learning tools -> machine learning techniques.

* DONE 
The effectiveness of this for the task of deriving knowledge from these 
recordings will be evaluated and results showing the utility of this 
system will be shown.
->
The effectiveness of our semi-automatic approach for deriving
knowledge ...

* DONE 
will be evaluated -> has been evaluated and the results of this
evaluation are presented and discussed.

Chapter 1 - Introduction

* DONE 
On the other hand, the rapid pace of development of audio feature
extraction and machine learning algorithms would make it difficult for
a biologist to be an expert in the currently accepted most effective
way to use them. -> sentence is kind of clunky. Do you intend on the
other hand ? Should it be "In addition, " ? Maybe mention explicitly
"and would require a computer science expert to apply them" or
something along those lines.

* DONE 
using tools that run on such -> ??

* DONE 
have occured in the past [Yur05] for small datasets -> for small
datasets [Yur05]

* DONE 
In the bibliography [VDS99] the authors are not separated by commas

* DONE 
The vast size of the new bioacoustic archives presents challenges for
these traditional tools based on a single computer model of
computation. -> on a single computer model of computation and designed
to work on individual sound recordings rather than collections of
them.

* DONE 
I would prefer size to be expressed in hours/minutes in addition to
terra/peta bytes.

* DONE 
only a very few number of experts -> only few experts

* DONE 
There already exist systems for enabling these members of the public
to be citizen scientists and to help biologists by annotating data. ->
This sounds like it has already been done extensively. I would leave
it more open. Something like:

These member of the public are engaged and with some training can be
citizen scientists and help biologistcs by annotating data.

* DONE 
In this thesis a system is developed -> (This paragraph has a lot of
repetition of "This system" - try rewriting some of the sentences to
avoid this repetition

* DONE 
collected over the last 30 years by Orcalab -> I don't think you have
mentioned Orcalab before, I would suggest adding: by Orcalab, a
research station for studying Orcas.

* DONE 
This thesis will demonstrate the following novel contributions
to the field -> This thesis describes the following significant
and novel contributions:

* DONE 
You use development too much. Just go direct instead
of "Development of a system" -> "A system ... "

* DONE 
I would merge 1 and 3 into a single contribution.
I would also merge 4 and 5 into a single contribution


* DONE 
but also the fields from which them come -> from which they come


* DONE 
It has only been in recent years that computer hard drives and RAM has
become able to store the large amounts of data that sound represents
-> computer hard drives and RAM have become able ... that are required
to represent sound.

* DONE 
represents another quantum leap -> represents a big challenge and 
opportunity, at the same time,

* TODO
Some of the material in Section 1.3 MIR and Bioacoustics is also
present in the previous section 1.2 Large Bioacoustic Archives -> I
would suggest moving all the bioacoustics stuff to 1.2 and just focus
on the transfer of techniques for MIR in 1.3.

* DONE 
local computer -> single computer

* DONE 
The Music Information Retrieval tools used to analyze this audio are 
also im- practical to use on a single computer, the time it takes to 
analyze the audio, and the amount of storage space makes it impractical 
to analyze large collections of audio data on a single computer. -> 
clunky sentence

* DONE 
recorded by OrcaLab, researchers must currently travel to Hanson Island 
-> Making it clearer:

Before the creation of the Orchive, researchers wanting to study ....

* TODO
GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT CHAPTER 1: I think you should have an explicit
section that talks about Orcas and Orcalab. Currently the information
about them is scattered in different subsections and revealed at
different levels of detail (partly due to some degree of cutting and
pasting from previous writings).  As Orca vocalizations are at the
core of what you have done I think you should have a section specific
to them and Orcalab in the Introduction even if you expand on it later
in the paper. There a three paragraphs that repeat the same
information about the Orcalab. Try to consolidate them in a single,
keep all the details but avoiding repetition.

GENERAL GUIDELINE: some text repetition is not a big problem if it is 
across chapters
but within a chapter you should try to avoid repetition

* TODO
I would also suggest pushing Distributed Cognition earlier in the
motivation of the work.

1.4 Scope of this work

* TODO
This section feels truncated and the chapter ends somewhat abruptly.
It is a good idea to have a summary of the chapter with a final
paragraph leading into the next chapter to provide some continuity in
the reading.
