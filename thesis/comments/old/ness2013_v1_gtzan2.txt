* DONE 
(meta-comment: you should put somewhere in the thesis a
nice picture of an Orca)

* DONE 
General comment: I really enjoyed reading this chapter - it
is well written and informative. well done. I have lots
comments but they are mostly minor

* TODO
General comment: Add a summary section at the end of the chapter
briefly summarizing what has been covered and ending with a connecting
sentence to the next chapter

Chapter 2


* DONE 
Orcinus orca -> Orcinus Orca will also be reviewed.



* DONE 
for the use of machine learning -> for use with machine learning

* DONE 
of the use of waveform -> of waveform

* DONE 
A brief overview of the field of pitch detection, in which algorithms 
that primarily use the autocorrelation of a time based representation of 
sound and of the use of these methods in the study of bioacoustics will 
be provided. ->
clunky sentence, break it in two.

* DONE 
Raven and MATLAB. -> Raven and MATLB typically one file at a time.

* DONE 
Intelligence Augmentation -> try to find a relevant citation

* DONE 
One of the largest hurdles -> Some of the largest hurdles

* DONE 
  n order to assist scientists with large datasets, the use of citizen 
science and crowdsourcing has been used for many years, with approaches 
as diverse as the collection of word use for the Oxford English 
Dictionary, the use of far-flung citizen scientists to aid Linnaeus with 
the study of taxonomy, to the work of Dr. Fred Urquhart in the study of 
monarch butterfly migrations
-> One or more relevant citations would be good

* DONE 
In On the Soul -> In "One the Soul"
similarly for History of Animals

(btw cool references to Aristotle)

* DONE 
for the echolocation cliks of bats -> for navigation using echolocation 
clicks
by bats,

Poecile spp. -> is this spp. a typo ?

* DONE 
One of the earliest studies was described by a paper in 1967 by 
Singleton and Poulter [SP67] in which a detailed spectral analysis of 
the calls of captive Killer Whales in which a digital approach using a 
Fast Fourier Transform was used to produce an spectrogram of short 
regions of audio.
-> double in which - break sentence in two and rewrite more clearly

* DONE 
In bibliography:
[CAN96] J Morphol -> Journal of Morphology ??

* DONE 
[Cra00] missing venue

* DONE 
[W06] expand to Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
(in general in the bibliography for a thesis it is customary
to not abbreviate as you don't have any space restrictions
like in conferences and journals)

* DONE 
[FF83] missing venue ?

* DONE 
[BLFH96] Incosistent capitalization of author names


* DONE 
and this thesis discusses its use as applied to chant traditions from 
cultures around the world in another chapter. ->
appendix ??

* DONE 
[JM06] -> volume ?, number ?

* DONE 
[NRH+99] -> there is a weird ? symbol next to an author

* DONE 
[HO86] -> missing book title or venue

* DONE 
[IEE00] -> missing venue Proceedings of the IEEE ?

* DONE 
[WWLA00] -> missing commas between authors

* DONE 
by bout analysis -> what is this ?

* DONE 
[Jan13] -> is this a journal or a book. needs more info


* DONE 
crossvalidation ->  cross-validation

* DONE 
[Dee] -> missing year


* TODO
Section 2.2 (Systems for working with large audio corpora) -> You need
some kind of intro sentence connecting with the previous section and
the theses. As written it is unclear what you are going to be talking
about.

* DONE 
This becomes prohibitive in the age of the Million Song Dataset. -> 
confusing for
someone not familiar with MIR.

* DONE 
However, there are considerable barriers to getting a productive Java 
development and production system installed and maintained-> either 
explain what those are or remove this sentence. Otherwise it does  not 
carry any information.

* DONE 
This archive of data is now available in electronic form wihch makes it 
easier to access than when it was on a single set of analogue tapes at 
OrcaLab, what would make it even more useful to scientists would be the 
ability to collaborate together on the process of annotating audio, 
running experiments and analyzing results.  -> clunky sentence, rewrite 
and break
into two.

* DONE 
[BS91] Ccsw -> CCSW - you can preserve capitalization by doing {CCSW}

* DONE 
who have shown interest in this archive -> who could be interested in 
this archive
(have shown is too strong)

* DONE 
will be a worthwhile challenge -> is a worthwhile challenge

* DONE 
[Gru88] -> capitalize ccsw

* DONE 
[LBF06] -> is there a venue for this ? technical report ?

* DONE 
Most of these systems failed to take into account that in the real world.
-> incomplete sentence

* DONE 
Through a user interface with fast feedback -> there is a funny 
character before the 100ms

* DONE 
Games-with-a-purpose (GWAP) [vAD08], which are computer games that 
harness the ability of people to solve tasks in a game setting. -> 
incomplete sentence

* DONE 
[SLP+08] -> expand acronyms in citation

* DONE 
This kind of system directly inspired the work we describe earlier with 
GWAP, and how we are developing a system to let users help us to 
classify orca calls, and by using active learning we can help to make 
this game fun and challenging. ->
-> break into two sentences
