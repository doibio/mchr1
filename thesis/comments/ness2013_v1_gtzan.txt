Overall it reads well and is in good shape but needs some polishing.

The Orchive : A system for semi-automatic annotation and analysis of a 
large collection of bioacoustic recordings.

* DONE 
Abstract
(too many uses of system - try to reduce)

* DONE 
have allowed for the collection -> have enabled the collection

* DONE 
when large collections -> when processing large collections

* DONE 
system to allow -> system that assists

* DONE 
and annotate these collections. -> and annotate these collections is
proposed.

* DONE 
provides functionality to allow for the -> supports semi-automatic

* DONE 
machine learning tools -> machine learning techniques.

* DONE 
The effectiveness of this for the task of deriving knowledge from these 
recordings will be evaluated and results showing the utility of this 
system will be shown.
->
The effectiveness of our semi-automatic approach for deriving
knowledge ...

* DONE 
will be evaluated -> has been evaluated and the results of this
evaluation are presented and discussed.

Chapter 1 - Introduction

* DONE 
On the other hand, the rapid pace of development of audio feature
extraction and machine learning algorithms would make it difficult for
a biologist to be an expert in the currently accepted most effective
way to use them. -> sentence is kind of clunky. Do you intend on the
other hand ? Should it be "In addition, " ? Maybe mention explicitly
"and would require a computer science expert to apply them" or
something along those lines.

* DONE 
using tools that run on such -> ??

* DONE 
have occured in the past [Yur05] for small datasets -> for small
datasets [Yur05]

* DONE 
In the bibliography [VDS99] the authors are not separated by commas

* DONE 
The vast size of the new bioacoustic archives presents challenges for
these traditional tools based on a single computer model of
computation. -> on a single computer model of computation and designed
to work on individual sound recordings rather than collections of
them.

* DONE 
I would prefer size to be expressed in hours/minutes in addition to
terra/peta bytes.

* DONE 
only a very few number of experts -> only few experts

* DONE 
There already exist systems for enabling these members of the public
to be citizen scientists and to help biologists by annotating data. ->
This sounds like it has already been done extensively. I would leave
it more open. Something like:

These member of the public are engaged and with some training can be
citizen scientists and help biologistcs by annotating data.

* DONE 
In this thesis a system is developed -> (This paragraph has a lot of
repetition of "This system" - try rewriting some of the sentences to
avoid this repetition

* DONE 
collected over the last 30 years by Orcalab -> I don't think you have
mentioned Orcalab before, I would suggest adding: by Orcalab, a
research station for studying Orcas.

* DONE 
This thesis will demonstrate the following novel contributions
to the field -> This thesis describes the following significant
and novel contributions:

* DONE 
You use development too much. Just go direct instead
of "Development of a system" -> "A system ... "

* DONE 
I would merge 1 and 3 into a single contribution.
I would also merge 4 and 5 into a single contribution


* DONE 
but also the fields from which them come -> from which they come


* DONE 
It has only been in recent years that computer hard drives and RAM has
become able to store the large amounts of data that sound represents
-> computer hard drives and RAM have become able ... that are required
to represent sound.

* DONE 
represents another quantum leap -> represents a big challenge and 
opportunity, at the same time,

* DONE 
Some of the material in Section 1.3 MIR and Bioacoustics is also
present in the previous section 1.2 Large Bioacoustic Archives -> I
would suggest moving all the bioacoustics stuff to 1.2 and just focus
on the transfer of techniques for MIR in 1.3.

* DONE 
local computer -> single computer

* DONE 
The Music Information Retrieval tools used to analyze this audio are 
also im- practical to use on a single computer, the time it takes to 
analyze the audio, and the amount of storage space makes it impractical 
to analyze large collections of audio data on a single computer. -> 
clunky sentence

* DONE 
recorded by OrcaLab, researchers must currently travel to Hanson Island 
-> Making it clearer:

Before the creation of the Orchive, researchers wanting to study ....

* DONE 
GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT CHAPTER 1: I think you should have an explicit
section that talks about Orcas and Orcalab. Currently the information
about them is scattered in different subsections and revealed at
different levels of detail (partly due to some degree of cutting and
pasting from previous writings).  As Orca vocalizations are at the
core of what you have done I think you should have a section specific
to them and Orcalab in the Introduction even if you expand on it later
in the paper. There a three paragraphs that repeat the same
information about the Orcalab. Try to consolidate them in a single,
keep all the details but avoiding repetition.

* DONE 
GENERAL GUIDELINE: some text repetition is not a big problem if it is
across chapters but within a chapter you should try to avoid
repetition

* DONE 
I would also suggest pushing Distributed Cognition earlier in the
motivation of the work.

1.4 Scope of this work

* DONE 
This section feels truncated and the chapter ends somewhat abruptly.
It is a good idea to have a summary of the chapter with a final
paragraph leading into the next chapter to provide some continuity in
the reading.

* DONE 
(meta-comment: you should put somewhere in the thesis a
nice picture of an Orca)

* DONE 
General comment: I really enjoyed reading this chapter - it
is well written and informative. well done. I have lots
comments but they are mostly minor

* DONE 
General comment: Add a summary section at the end of the chapter
briefly summarizing what has been covered and ending with a connecting
sentence to the next chapter

Chapter 2


* DONE 
Orcinus orca -> Orcinus Orca will also be reviewed.



* DONE 
for the use of machine learning -> for use with machine learning

* DONE 
of the use of waveform -> of waveform

* DONE 
A brief overview of the field of pitch detection, in which algorithms 
that primarily use the autocorrelation of a time based representation of 
sound and of the use of these methods in the study of bioacoustics will 
be provided. ->
clunky sentence, break it in two.

* DONE 
Raven and MATLAB. -> Raven and MATLB typically one file at a time.

* DONE 
Intelligence Augmentation -> try to find a relevant citation

* DONE 
One of the largest hurdles -> Some of the largest hurdles

* DONE 
  n order to assist scientists with large datasets, the use of citizen 
science and crowdsourcing has been used for many years, with approaches 
as diverse as the collection of word use for the Oxford English 
Dictionary, the use of far-flung citizen scientists to aid Linnaeus with 
the study of taxonomy, to the work of Dr. Fred Urquhart in the study of 
monarch butterfly migrations
-> One or more relevant citations would be good

* DONE 
In On the Soul -> In "One the Soul"
similarly for History of Animals

(btw cool references to Aristotle)

* DONE 
for the echolocation cliks of bats -> for navigation using echolocation 
clicks
by bats,

Poecile spp. -> is this spp. a typo ?

* DONE 
One of the earliest studies was described by a paper in 1967 by 
Singleton and Poulter [SP67] in which a detailed spectral analysis of 
the calls of captive Killer Whales in which a digital approach using a 
Fast Fourier Transform was used to produce an spectrogram of short 
regions of audio.
-> double in which - break sentence in two and rewrite more clearly

* DONE 
In bibliography:
[CAN96] J Morphol -> Journal of Morphology ??

* DONE 
[Cra00] missing venue

* DONE 
[W06] expand to Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
(in general in the bibliography for a thesis it is customary
to not abbreviate as you don't have any space restrictions
like in conferences and journals)

* DONE 
[FF83] missing venue ?

* DONE 
[BLFH96] Incosistent capitalization of author names


* DONE 
and this thesis discusses its use as applied to chant traditions from 
cultures around the world in another chapter. ->

* DONE 
[JM06] -> volume ?, number ?

* DONE 
[NRH+99] -> there is a weird ? symbol next to an author

* DONE 
[HO86] -> missing book title or venue

* DONE 
[IEE00] -> missing venue Proceedings of the IEEE ?

* DONE 
[WWLA00] -> missing commas between authors

* DONE

* DONE 
[Jan13] -> is this a journal or a book. needs more info


* DONE 
crossvalidation ->  cross-validation

* DONE 
[Dee] -> missing year

* DONE 
Section 2.2 (Systems for working with large audio corpora) -> You need
some kind of intro sentence connecting with the previous section and
the theses. As written it is unclear what you are going to be talking
about.

* DONE 
This becomes prohibitive in the age of the Million Song Dataset. -> 
confusing for
someone not familiar with MIR.

* DONE 
However, there are considerable barriers to getting a productive Java 
development and production system installed and maintained-> either 
explain what those are or remove this sentence. Otherwise it does  not 
carry any information.

* DONE 
This archive of data is now available in electronic form wihch makes it 
easier to access than when it was on a single set of analogue tapes at 
OrcaLab, what would make it even more useful to scientists would be the 
ability to collaborate together on the process of annotating audio, 
running experiments and analyzing results.  -> clunky sentence, rewrite 
and break
into two.

* DONE 
[BS91] Ccsw -> CCSW - you can preserve capitalization by doing {CCSW}

* DONE 
who have shown interest in this archive -> who could be interested in 
this archive
(have shown is too strong)

* DONE 
will be a worthwhile challenge -> is a worthwhile challenge

* DONE 
[Gru88] -> capitalize ccsw

* DONE 
[LBF06] -> is there a venue for this ? technical report ?

* DONE 
Most of these systems failed to take into account that in the real world.
-> incomplete sentence

* DONE 
Through a user interface with fast feedback -> there is a funny 
character before the 100ms

* DONE 
Games-with-a-purpose (GWAP) [vAD08], which are computer games that 
harness the ability of people to solve tasks in a game setting. -> 
incomplete sentence

* DONE 
[SLP+08] -> expand acronyms in citation

* DONE 
This kind of system directly inspired the work we describe earlier with 
GWAP, and how we are developing a system to let users help us to 
classify orca calls, and by using active learning we can help to make 
this game fun and challenging. ->
-> break into two sentences

Chapter 3 comments

* DONE 
General comment: Add footnotes with urls for all the programming stuff
(ruby, python, phonegap etc)

* DONE 
General comment: I think you need to restucture and rename the chapters as
follows:

Chapter 3 Orchive Software Design and Architecture

Merge chapter 4 into this

Chapter 4 Automatic and Semi-Automatic Analysis

Move all the feature descriptions and machine learning
stuff from Chapter 5

Chapter 5 Evaluation

* DONE 
of 44100 samples/sec means  -> this means

* DONE 
Firstly that it allowed -> Firstly it should allow

* DONE 
was that it allows -> was that is should allow

* DONE 
where regions where orca were vocalizing -> the regions where orcas were 
vocalizing

* DONE 
3.1 Choice of Platform -> 3.1 Design Considerations

* DONE 
  were precalculated using Marsyas and were stored on the server at a 
number of different zoom levels
-> I think that so far you have not mentioned Marsyas so you should a 
short sentence
(and citation) explaining what it is

* DONE 
3,900 people who have viewed the site with over 10,000 individual visits 
-> that's incredible
I did not know that

* DONE 
was begun from scratch. -> was started from scratch ?

* 
In order to improve latency, the Javascript interface sends multiple 
requests for rect- angular sections of the visible spectrogram, which 
allows multiple cores on the server to generate spectrograms in 
parallel. In addition, these spectrograms are cached in memory on the 
server (using memcached) to speed subsequent requests for the same 
region of a spectrogram.
-> it would be nice if possible to add a small figure or table showing 
speedup from doing single core generation of spectrogram vs multiple cores

* DONE 
from Labeling  -> from labeling

* DONE 
For my evaluation -> For the evaluation

* DONE 
The first set of tools are audio feature extraction tools that have been 
adapted from the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) [FD02] to 
the study of orca vocalizations. -> incomplete sentence

* DONE 
Section 3.6
The first two paragraphs are essentially repeats of things you have 
talked about before.

* DONE 
You need a summary section, summarizing the findings and connecting
to the rest of the thesis

* DONE 
General comment: This chapter should only have results and definitions
of evaluation metrics like classification accuracy.  The other stuff
should go to previous chapters.  For example the definition of the
classification problems should be provided earlier. It is also tedious
to read with all the tables and descriptions. Breaking it into
subsections and having summary sections for each task will make it
much easier to read.

* DONE 
nd more specifically are the stereotyped pulsed calls. -> more
specifically the stereotyped pulsed calls

* DONE 
n the course of work done for this thesis, this author added new audio
feature extraction subsystems to Marsyas, including the porting of the
Yin pitch detector from Aubio to Marsyas -> I would move that to
Chapter 3 and have a subsection about Marsyas and how it works
together with the Orchive.

* DONE 
Aubio -> readers don't know what this is

* DONE 
[LQ11] -> capitalize mfcc an pnn

* DONE 
diagram showing the definition of window size, hop size, memory 5.1. -> bad
sentence

* DONE 
I like Figure 5.1 - it would be good to move closer to the text that
refers to it if possible.

* DONE 
a voice note made -> voice notes made

* DONE 
on if they contained orca calls -> on whether they contained

* DONE 
Move the description of MFCC to chapter on automatic and
semi-automatic analysis

* DONE 
to our symbolic approximation algorithm. -> what is the symbolic
approximation algorithm ? Reader does not know anything about it at
this point

* DONE 
from a power spectrum of the features -> from the power spectrum of
the audio signal

Comments on Table 5.1

* DONE 
You should explain extract, train and predict time (for table 5.1) In
Table 5.1 make the best entry in each column bold.

* DONE 
I would suggest adding a vertical line for each "group" combination of
ws and hp (the first 8 entries, the next 8, ....).  For the Extract,
Train and Predict time you can make a line spanning three columns and
put Time and then under it have Extract, Train, Predict Change percent
correct to Accuracy(%)

* DONE 
Make similar changes (horizontal grouping lines, bold for best values,
Time and Accuracy changes) to Table 2

* DONE 
Move the liblinear description to the automatic and semi-automatic
analysis chapter.

* DONE 
where C is a penalty parameter -> \noindent where $C$ is a penalty
parameter

* DONE 
Try to make Table 5.4 more digestible similarly to the previous two by
adding horizontal lines, bold for best entries and the changes to the
times and accuracy labels

* DONE 
I did not realize that the particular liblinear formulation can have
such a dramatic effect on training time. This is good to know.

* DONE 
Move the feature description to the automatic and semi-automatic
analysis chapter.

* DONE 
I would suggest putting the investigation of different features in a
separate subsection.

* DONE 
[DT96] missing venue

* DONE 
In the descriptions of the features you use inconsistent notation for
the power spectrum vector (M for centroid, N for flux, Y) - you should
make the notation consistent - just pick one and stick to it.

* DONE 
You need to explain the symbols in the SFM measure equation

* DONE 
[HK07] -> expand MMSP -> Proceedings of the IEEE Multimedia Signal
Processing Workshop

* DONE 
which are often used is an estimate of the fundamental frequency (F0)
or pitch. -> which are often used to calculate an estimate

* DONE 
with harmonics that strictly decrease the lowest peak -> with
harmonics that strictly decrease, the lowest peak

* DONE 
Table 5.5, Table 5.6 modify as suggested for the previous tables
Similarly for 5.7, 5.8, (horizontal lines, bold for best entries, etc)

* DONE 
I would make the downsampling a separate subsection

* DONE 
Table 5.11 add horizontal lines

* DONE 
For this reason, all subsequent tables do not use downsampling, and to
accommodate the long training and prediction times, a large cluster
was used, and each job was given the maximum allowable three day run
time to complete. -> I am not sure if you do expand on this later but
you should have a subsection talking about how you impemented the
cluster based feature extraction and machine learning

* DONE 
does for linear kernels, can exhibit -> does for linear kernal, and
can exhibit

* DONE 
The usual visual improvements for Table 5.12, 5.13

* DONE 
I would break the results to different subsections (non-linear
kernels, other machine learning algorithms etc) for easier
reading. Currently it is a little bit exhausting to read all the
tables and experiments as one giant section.

* DONE 
The usual for 5.14, 5.15

* DONE

information entropy at each leaf -> and constructs a tree that makes
the optimal decision based on information entropy at each leaf.

* DONE 
the more efficiently trainable Deep Belief Networks on this
dataset. -> DBN are not more efficiently trainable - they are actually
really costly to train but have better classification performance.

* DONE 
!!!! You need a summar subsection for the OBV task that summarizes the
conclusions from all the experiments you did. Currently they are
burried in the barrage of data tables and descriptions.

Section 5.2 Comments

* DONE 
We call the call catalog -> We name the call catalog (call the call 
sounds funny)

* DONE 
In order to classify the clips in the ORCACALL dataset, a different 
experimental procedure to that used in the ORCAOBV results above. -> In 
order to classify the clips in the ORCACALL dataset, we use a different 
experimental procedure to that used in the ORCAOBV results presented in 
the previous section.

* DONE 
experimetntal -> experimental

* DONE 
the usual cosmetics to Table 5.20

* DONE 
Because of the longer size of window that results from using
a bigger window, a window size of 2048 and 100 MFCCs will be used in 
subsequent tables. ->
clunky sentence, rewrite and break in two

* DONE 
Cosmetic changes to all the Tables

* DONE 
You should mention something about what the ZeroR baseline would be
for the calls and that the 5x% results are very encouraging
considering that there are many more classes. 

* DONE 
You also need to be more explicit (maybe a table) about what are the
classes. I think it would be really nice to have a table with a
spectrogram of a characteristic call of each class but that's
optional.

* DONE 
Similarly to the previous section, a subsection summarizing the conclusions
should be provided.

* DONE 
Theano requires considerable time and expertise to setup in its most 
efficient GPU configuration, and using the available hardware and was 
unfortunately unable to be used. -> clunky, break in two and rewrite

* DONE 
to run these results using Theano -> to run these experiments using Theano

* DONE 
The purpose of these experiments is to find the combination of audio 
features and machine learning algorithm that gives the highest 
performance, and to then use this combination to predict classes for all 
recordings in the Orchive. In order to investigate the performance of 
the classification of recordings into Orca, Background and Voice, we 
trained a SVM with a section of 30 and 240 seconds of hand trimmed data 
using the bextract program in Marsyas. We then used the sfplugin program 
in Marsyas to classify all the recordings in the Orchive on the 
Hermes/Nestor cluster, part of the Westgrid computational resource. For 
this we divided the data into sets of 1%, 5%, 10% and 100% of the 
Orchive. The timing results of these datasets run on 10 computers are 
shown in Table 5.36. From this we can see that the classifier that had 
more data took longer to classify, and that the speedup from taking 
samples of the data was almost linear. -> This should go in a separate 
subsection called scaling
and moved the the ORCAOBV section.

* DONE 
The reader has no idea what bextract and sfplugin are. You should maybe 
briefly explain.

Section 5.3

* DONE 
You need to add 2-3 sentences explaining what you are trying to do and
why it is useful (i.e comparing pitch contours). Then you also need
1-2 sentences explaining why it would be interesting to apply
bioinformatics algorithms (efficient, well developed but work on
character strings). As a general comment you are good at explaining
what you did but the "why" you did it needs to be more emphasized.

* DONE 
Make Figures 5.2 and 5.3 bigger

* DONE 
This approach is certainly valid if slope changes within a given
window characterize the signal well and the signal is fairly free of
noise. -> This approach is certainly valid if the slope changes within
a given window characterize the signal well, and the signal is fairly
free of noise.

* DONE 
or a possible avenue -> as a possible avenue

* DONE 
We determined, however, that considering windowed slope fragments of
Orca vocalizations does produce sequences that are of lower quality
than those produced by our transcription technique which we refer to
as FTSQ (Fundamental Frequency Time Series Quantization). -> This is
slightly confusing. I think you should be more explicitly. Initialy we
tried SAX but we did not get the results we expected. This lead us to
develop a different technique which we term FTSQ.

* DONE 
of an audio signal is am approach -> is an approach

* DONE 
Figure 5.4 should also have N09 in time domain

* DONE 
Figure 5.6 looks like it is a single call but you mention that it is two 
calls.

* DONE 
our OpenMIR platform -> the reader has no idea what the OpenMIR platform 
is.

* DONE 
There should be a summary section for 5.3 that should also mention
that this was a preliminary investigation and complete results with
recall/classification need to still be performed.

* DONE 
(You should also mark all the parts where you mention future work so that
you can mention them in the Future Work section again)

* DONE 
Figures 5.11 and 5.12 should be move closer to the text that refers to it.

Section 5.4

* DONE 
The Figures should be moved to be closer to the text that refers to them.

* DONE 
Last year, we had written a much more involved interface that had many 
more features, such as multiple turns per level where the user was first 
presented with only the sounds and was asked to guess the clip, then if 
...
were interested in the current work if the simplest possible game 
mechanic was
engaging for users. -> a little bit confusing and apologetic. The reader 
is left
wondering why was this not used ? Why is it mentioned ?

* 
I am thinking that maybe there should be a separate chapter on
Interfaces that would describe the Orchive GUI stuff + have the game
stuff. For now just keep it there but give it a thought. 

* DONE 
You also need to talk more about the interface for creating Orca
Games. Currently it is barely mentioned.

Section 5.5

* DONE 
This section seems a little bit weak and not very specific. I think
you can probably expand on it a little bit more. For example what were
the questions you were trying to answer through your observation. It
is good that you acknowledge your bias but you can also be more
specific about what you hoped for, how what you observed was different
etc. I think having testimonials is good and you should get some more.
