Figure 3.7 looks really badly pixelated

Section 3.5 seems a little bit unconnected with what comes before and
after. Some of the material you have already mentioned but
then there is the Westgrid stuff which I think should be on its
own section or at least subsection

Section 3.7 in some way overlap with 3.5. Maybe try to read them
carefully and remove redundancies merging these two sections

From this we can see that the accuracy only slightly depends on the
FFT parameters, but that in general, higher accuracy is obtained with
an intermediate memory size.

about Table 5.1 which is what you should refer to

Ok I am done reading all the thesis except the ABMI appendix.

Overall I think it is ready to go to Peter and Peggy so please go ahead
and send them a draft with also a timeline for the request for oral.

Some general comments

* DONE 
1) The future work section is really weak. You can easily add 2-3 more
   pages.

* DONE 
2) In the publications listed in the appendix you mix publications
related to the thesis and other ones that are not like the
sonophenology. My suggestion would be to make to subsection one with
direct publications related to the thesis and another with the other
ones (cantillion, sonophenology etc). You can also write a little
blurb in that section explaining how the research described in these
papers (for example cantillion) informed and influenced the research
described in the thesis.

* TODO
3) In the conclusions and introduction you mention that the focus of
the thesis is the creation of a system to annotate a large archive of
bioacoustic recordings. One possible criticism you might face is that
you just describe a system implementation not new research. It is
mostly a matter of writing and emphasis. I think you should try to
emphasize the "challenge/problem" annotating very large bioacoustics
archives. So instead of saying the focus of this thesis is the
creation of a system you would say "The focus of this thesis is
addressing the challenging of analyzing and interacting ....  It is
hard to pinpoint all the parts where this takes place and it only
formed in my mind after reading the whole thing which is why I am not
more specific. Hopefully you can do a quick pass and find a few
strategic places to make such changes.

Overall good job - it describes a lot of work and it is well written.
