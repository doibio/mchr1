\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

The visualization of the high-dimensional feature landscapes that
are encountered when analyzing audio data is a challenging problem
and is the focus of much research in the field of Music Information
Retrieval.  Typical feature sets extracted from sound have anywhere
from dozens to hundreds of dimensions and have complex
interrelationships between data elements.  In this work, we apply
various modern techniques for the visualization of data to a number
of diverse problem domains, including the bioacoustics of Orcinus
Orca (killer whale) song, partially annotated chant traditions
including Torah recitation and the the analysis of music
collections and live DJ sets.  We also develop a number of
graphical user interfaces to allow users to interact with these
visualizations.  These interfaces include Flash-enabled web
applications, desktop applications, and novel interfaces including
the use of the Radiodrum, a three-dimension position sensing
musical interface.
