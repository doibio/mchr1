In particular, the third problem of audio interference is serious for blind users, since multimedia content often contains streaming media such as video and music which continuously play sounds, and thus they cannot hear the speech, which is masked by the loud media. In this paper, we propose a new accessible browser that can directly manipulate such multimedia content. In order to control Flash contents, our browser relies on a transcoding HTTP proxy to inject special scripts into the Flash content and then manipulates the embedded streaming media and sound objects via the injected scripts. By using our browser, users can easily turn the volume up or down, play, stop, or pause the streaming media with shortcut keys. Since the users do not need to focus on buttons or sliders for these operations, they can immediately stop or fade out the intrusive media when listening to speech from assistive software.},

  abstract = 	 {Try this simple experiment one day: wear a couple of earplugs and try to conduct your regular everyday activities, for a couple of hours. How would you describe your feelings in that deafened state? You would probably feel a sense of isolation, from the world and from other people. So, absence of sound induces perceived isolation which may turn into felt oppression in some environments, such as an anechoic chamber. One may think that if silence induces isolation, sound induces presence, but unfortunately this is not the case. We know sensitive souls that have difficulties falling asleep because they live in noisy neighborhoods. One solution that may work in this case is to play loud noise through the hi-fi loudspeakers to mask the noise from the environment. Again, isolation (e.g. from street noise) is the result, but the means to achieve it is loud noise, the opposite of silence. And how would you describe all those people that experience modern city life being shielded by earphones that play music from their walkmans or mp3 players? They look rather isolated from each other, donâ€™t they? In some circumstances there might be a need of concentration (e.g., in studying), or people want to tune their mood (Brodsky 2002). In all those cases sounds may be the appropriate mean, as it was well known even to Thomas Edison, who used to accompany commercialization of his phonograph with a â€œmood change chartâ€ aimed at surveying users reactions to that new technology. So, it seems that sounds have the potential to modulate human engagement (from isolation to arousal) in everyday environments, and this is an aspect that should be seriously considered when designing the artefacts that will populate the environments of the future, likely to be pervaded by Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in its various facets.},

		  quantified tonal hierarchies. A toroidal representation of
		  key distances is recovered in which keys are located near
		  their neighbors on the circle of fifths, and both parallel
		  and relative major/minor key pairs are proximal. The map is
		  used to represent dynamic changes in the sense of key as
		  cues to key become more or less clear and modulations
		  occur. Two models, one using tone distributions and the
		  other using tone transitions, are proposed for key-finding.
		  The tone transition model takes both pitch and temporal
		  distance between tones into account. Both models produce
		  results highly comparable to those of musically trained
		  listeners, who performed a probe tone task for ten
		  nine-chord sequences. A distributed mapping of tonality is
		  used to visualize activation patterns that change over
		  time. The location and spread of this activation pattern is
		  similar for experimental results and the key-finding

		  text documents are classification tasks based on "noisy"
		  input patterns. The "noise" arises because of the known

		  growing number of papers is dedicated to the usage of
		  self-organizing maps to organize the contents of such
		  digital libraries. These papers assume the central
		  availability of the data; an assumption that is
		  questionable given the massive amount of available
		  information. In this paper we describe an approach for
		  organizing distributed digital libraries based on a system
		  of independent self-organizing maps each of which
		  representing just a portion of the complete digital
		  library. Furthermore, we argue in favor of integrating
		  these independent maps in a hierarchical fashion, again by
		  means of self-organizing maps. The integration is based on
		  the trained low level maps.},

One of the challenges in modern multimedia system is to classify and retrieve certain kinds of audio from the database. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm for a content-based audio retrieval. the algorithm, called gradient-based fuzzy c-means algorithm with divergence measure (GBFCM(DM)), is a neural network-based algorithm which utilizes the divergence measure to exploit the statistical nature of the audio data to improve the classification accuracy. Experiment results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms 3. 025\%-5. 05\% in accuracy in comparison with conventional algorithms such as the k-means or the self-organizing map.",

A collection of popular music, in the form of MIDI-files, is analysed using the entropy-measures and techniques from pattern-recognition.

The paper describes a prototype system which automatically generates background music and sound effects for existing animations. The inputs to the system are music parameters (mood types and musical motifs) and motion parameters for individual scenes of an animation. Music is generated for each scene. The key for a scene is determined by considering the mood type and its degree, and the key of the previous scene. The melody for a scene is generated from the given motifs and the chord progression for the scene which is determined according to appropriate rules. The harmony accompaniment for a scene is selected based on the mood type. The rhythm accompaniment for a scene is selected based on the mood type and tempo. The sound effects for motions are determined according to the characteristics and intensity of the motions. Both the background music and sound effects are generated so that the transitions between scenes are smooth},

Music theories are embedded in the design so that melody flow and musical expressions like the pitch, rhythm and volume of the melody can be controlled and generated in real-time by wearing a pair of motion-sensing gloves. Also central to the design is the mapping of the hand motions and gestures to musical expressions that is intuitive and requires minimal training. Cyber Composer is expected to find applications in the fields of performance, composing, entertainment, education as well as psychotherapy},

Layer two allows processes to be collected into hierarchical group structures, with associated `virtual time systems' and nested musical transformations. Layer three provides pitches, scales, notes, rhythm specification, and higher-level musical abstractions. MOOD derives several benefits from C++ features such as inheritance and operator overloading: a simple and versatile syntax for music representation; a clean, layered structure for the internal scheduling mechanisms; easy factorization of the machine-dependent parts (MOOD runs on Sun 3 and 4 workstations under Unix and on the Macintosh)},

Interactive and automated fitness assignment are two different strategies to overcome these difficulties with different advantages and disadvantages. SENEgaL is a novel GA music system which generates rhythms of western Africa based on the idea of the critical damped oscillator (CDO) fitness function, where the user has to define his/her own target rhythmic patterns and the algorithm will converge towards these stylistic preferences in short running time. This innovative idea can be used for generating African-style or completely new rhythmic patterns whereas its graphical implementation can be proven an interesting music education tool, where the user will become familiar with rhythms, patterns and sounds, while trying to compose his/her own music piece.},

We present a system that automatically organizes a music collection according to the perceived sound similarity resembling genres or styles of music. Audio signals are processed according to psychoacoustic models to obtain a time-invariant representation of its characteristics. Subsequent clustering provides an intuitive interface where similar pieces of music are grouped together on a map display.},

abstract = {Music information retrieval (MIR) is steadily growing as a research area, as can be evidenced by the Int. Conf.s on music information retrieval (ISMIR) series and the increasing number of MIR-related publications. At present, various visualization techniques developed in the context of music information retrieval for representing polyphonic audio signals are already available. The techniques fall into two major categories: techniques for visualizing a single file or piece of music, and techniques for visual collections of pieces. The former includes similariy matrix, beat spectrum and beat spectrogram, beat histograms, real-time audio classification display, and mapping time-varying timbre to color. The latter covers timbre spaces, music similarity via self-organizing maps and smoothed data histograms, and combining different views. Regardless of the category, all of these techniques use sophisticated analysis algorithms to automatically extract content information from music stored in digital audio format.},

The Amazon reviews for the artists are obtained using the Amazon Web service interface and stored in the form of textual documents that form the basis for the formation of the SOMs. The idea is to spatially organize these textual documents wherein similar documents are located nearby. We make an attempt to exploit the similarities between different artist reviews to provide insights into similar artists that can be used in a recommendation service. We introduce the concept of a modified weighting scheme for text mining in the musical domain and demonstrate its role in improving the quality of the recommendations. Finally, we present results for a list of around 400 musical artists and validate them using recommendations from a popular recommendation service},

The high number of contour types characterizing more than 2 cultures simultaneously led to the supposition of a hypothetical common musical language, and the corresponding contour types were determined using a self-organizing map, being able to "understand" the six cultures in parallel. The analysis showed that significant parts of the common language are represented in the six national cultures, and it exists practically completely in Hungarian and Slovak folk music. The mapping of the melody sections and the contour types of the common language to a multidimensional "melody space" resulted in a clear musical description of the contacts, thus, the hypothesis of an archaic common musical tradition in Europe seems to be worth considering},

The proposed system allows us to realize the co-creative musical performance. Even though many autonomous systems for musical accompaniment and musical session have been developed so far, musical preference and ideas of the system user are not enough considered in the performance association. We developed an interactive rhythm generation system with the novel rhythm similarity based on the human's perception, and the rhythm maps constructed by the learning scheme with real human's performance. In perceptual experiments, we statistically examined the validity of the introduced rhythm suitability, and analyzed the constructed rhythm maps by the similarity. Finally, we concluded that the proposed system was effective for the co-creative musical performance through many trials of performances with human players.},

Open questions exist, for example â€” how can TDD approaches be applied to databases, GUIs, and distributed systems? What are the quantitative benchmarks that can demonstrate the value of TDD, and what are the best approaches to solve the ubiquitous issues of scalability?},

	Abstract = {The recent interest in sensor networks has led to a number of routing schemes that use the limited resources available at sensor nodes more efficiently. These schemes typically try to find the minimum energy path to optimize energy usage at a node. In this paper we take the view that always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40\% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},
