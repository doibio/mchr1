Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is highly expressed in the brain and 
modulates feeding behavior. It is also expressed in some peripheral tissues 
where its role remains unknown. We have investigated MCH function in human and 
mouse immune cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed a low expression of prepro-MCH and 
MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) but not of MCHR2 transcript in tissular and peripheral 
blood immune cells. FACS and in vitro assay studies demonstrated that MCHR1 
receptor expression on most cell types can trigger, in the presence of MCH, cAMP 
synthesis and calcium mobilization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs). Moreover, MCH treatment decreases the CD3-stimulated PBMC proliferation 
in vitro. Accordingly, our data indicate for the first time that MCH and MCHR1 
may exert immunomodulatory functions.
