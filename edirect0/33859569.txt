OBJECTIVES: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is closely adjacent to the coronary 
arteries and myocardium, its role as an endocrine organ to affect the 
pathophysiological processes of the coronary arteries and myocardium has been 
increasingly recognized. However, the specific gene expression profiles of EAT 
in coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been well characterized. Our aim was to 
investigate the role of EAT in CAD at the gene level.
METHODS: Here, we compared the histological and gene expression difference of 
EAT between CAD and non-CAD. We investigated the gene expression profiles in the 
EAT of patients with CAD through the high-throughput RNA sequencing. We 
performed bioinformatics analysis such as functional enrichment analysis and 
protein-protein interaction network construction to obtain and verify the hub 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the EAT of CAD.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the size of epicardial adipocytes in the CAD 
group was larger than in the control group. Our findings on the EAT gene 
expression profiles of CAD showed a total of 747 DEGs (fold change >2, p value 
<0.05). The enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that more pro-inflammatory and 
immunological genes and pathways were involved in CAD. Ten hub DEGs (GNG3, 
MCHR1, BDKRB1, MCHR2, CXCL8, CXCR5, CCR8, CCL4L1, TAS2R10, and TAS2R41) were 
identified.
CONCLUSION: Epicardial adipose tissue in CAD shows unique gene expression 
profiles and may act as key regulators in the CAD pathological process.
