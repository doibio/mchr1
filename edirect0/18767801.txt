An enantioselective synthesis of SNAP-7941, a potent melanin concentrating 
hormone receptor antagonist, was achieved by using two organocatalytic methods. 
The first method utilized to synthesize the enantioenriched dihydropyrimidone 
core was the Cinchona alkaloid-catalyzed Mannich reaction of beta-keto esters to 
acylimines and the second was the chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed Biginelli 
reaction. Completion of the synthesis was accomplished via selective urea 
formation at the N3 position of the dihydropyrimidone with the 
3-(4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)propylamine side chain fragment. The synthesis of 
SNAP-7921 highlights the utility of asymmetric organocatalytic methods in the 
construction of an important class of chiral heterocycles.
