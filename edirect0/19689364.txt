Many orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) have emerged as potential obesity 
targets. The authors are interested in the computer-aided discovery and 
development of small molecule anti-obesity agents targeting GPCR. Computational 
modeling studies have mainly been conducted on ghrelin receptor (GHS-R), 
melanocortin 4-receptor (MC4R), melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor (MCH1R) 
and cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) in recent publications. Here, a homology 
modeling strategy for these receptors will be introduced, and the key structural 
features of their active and inactive conformations will be reviewed. In 
addition, the authors describe the uses of virtual screening methods to identify 
novel antagonists of MCH1R and CB1R, which provide valuable examples of the 
computer-aided design and structural optimization of GPCR ligands.
