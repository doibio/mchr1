BACKGROUND: Tubby is the founding member of the tubby-like family of proteins. 
The naturally occurring tubby mutation in mice causes retinitis pigmentosa, 
hearing loss and obesity. Tubby has been proposed to function as an accessory 
factor in ciliary trafficking. We directly examined a role for tubby in ciliary 
trafficking in vivo.
METHODS: We used immunofluoresence labeling to examine the subcellular 
localization of rhodopsin, somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) and melanin 
concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), all of which are G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCR), in the retina and brain of wild type (WT) and tubby mutant 
mice.
RESULTS: In tubby mouse retina, rhodopsin is not fully transported across the 
connecting cilia to the outer segments with ensuing photoreceptor degeneration. 
In the tubby mouse brain, SSTR3 and MCHR1 fail to localize at the neuronal 
primary cilia in regions where these receptors play critical roles in neural 
signaling. The tubby mutant does not manifest a generalized defect in 
ciliogenesis or protein trafficking.
CONCLUSIONS: Tubby plays a critical role in trafficking select GPCRs to the 
cilia. This role is reminiscent of tubby-like proteins 1 and 3, which have been 
proposed to facilitate trafficking of rhodopsin and select GPCRs in 
photoreceptors and the developing neural tube, respectively. Thus tubby-like 
proteins may be generally involved in transciliary trafficking of GPCRs.
