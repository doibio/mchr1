Cilia on neurons play critical roles in both the development and function of the 
central nervous system (CNS). While it remains challenging to elucidate the 
precise roles for neuronal cilia, it is clear that a subset of G-protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs) preferentially localize to the cilia membrane. Further, 
ciliary GPCR signaling has been implicated in regulating a variety of behaviors. 
Melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), is a GPCR expressed centrally 
in rodents known to be enriched in cilia. Here we have used MCHR1 as a model 
ciliary GPCR to develop a strategy to fluorescently tag receptors expressed from 
the endogenous locus in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we inserted the coding sequence 
of the fluorescent protein mCherry into the N-terminus of Mchr1. Analysis of the 
fusion protein (mCherry MCHR1) revealed its localization to neuronal cilia in 
the CNS, across multiple developmental time points and in various regions of the 
adult brain. Our approach simultaneously produced fortuitous in/dels altering 
the Mchr1 start codon resulting in a new MCHR1 knockout line. Functional studies 
using electrophysiology show a significant alteration of synaptic strength in 
MCHR1 knockout mice. A reduction in strength is also detected in mice homozygous 
for the mCherry insertion, suggesting that while the strategy is useful for 
monitoring the receptor, activity could be altered. However, both lines should 
aid in studies of MCHR1 function and contribute to our understanding of MCHR1 
signaling in the brain. Additionally, this approach could be expanded to aid in 
the study of other ciliary GPCRs.
