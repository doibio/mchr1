Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) has been a target for appetite 
suppressants, which are helpful in treating obesity. However, it is challenging 
to develop an MCHR1 antagonist because its binding site is similar to that of 
the human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channel, whose inhibition may cause 
cardiotoxicity. Most drugs developed as MCHR1 antagonists have failed in 
clinical development due to cardiotoxicity caused by hERG inhibition. Machine 
learning-based prediction models can overcome these difficulties and provide new 
opportunities for drug discovery. In this study, we identified KRX-104130 with 
potent MCHR1 antagonistic activity and no cardiotoxicity through virtual 
screening using two MCHR1 binding affinity prediction models and an hERG-induced 
cardiotoxicity prediction model. In addition, we explored other possibilities 
for expanding the new indications for KRX-104130 using a transcriptome-based 
drug repositioning approach. KRX-104130 increased the expression of low-density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which induced cholesterol reduction in the gene 
expression analysis. This was confirmed by comparison with gene expression in a 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patient group. In a NASH mouse model, the 
administration of KRX-104130 showed a protective effect by reducing hepatic 
lipid accumulation, liver injury, and histopathological changes, indicating a 
promising prospect for the therapeutic effect of NASH as a new indication for 
MCHR1 antagonists.
