Optimization of the lead 2a led to the identification of a novel diarylketoxime 
class of melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor (MCH-1R) antagonists. Our 
focus was directed toward improvement of hERG activity and metabolic stability. 
The representative derivative 4b showed potent and dose-dependent body weight 
reduction in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice after oral administration. 
The synthesis and structure-activity relationships of the novel diarylketoxime 
MCH-1R antagonists are described.
