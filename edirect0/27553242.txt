Most of the previous content of this book has focused on obtaining the 
structures of membrane proteins. In this chapter we explore how those structures 
can be further used in two key ways. The first is their use in structure based 
drug design (SBDD) and the second is how they can be used to extend our 
understanding of their functional activity via the use of molecular dynamics. 
Both aspects now heavily rely on computations. This area is vast, and alas, too 
large to consider in depth in a single book chapter. Thus where appropriate we 
have referred the reader to recent reviews for deeper assessment of the field. 
We discuss progress via the use of examples from two main drug target areas; 
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. We end with a discussion 
of some of the main challenges in the area.
