To address the hERG liability of MCHR1 antagonists such as 1 and 2, new analogs 
such as 4 and 5 that incorporated a polar heteroaryl group were designed and 
synthesized. Biological evaluation confirmed that these new analogs retained MCH 
R1 activity with greatly attenuated hERG liabilities as indicated in the Rb 
efflux assay.
