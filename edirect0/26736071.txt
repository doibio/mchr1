Aiming to discover melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonists 
with improved safety profiles, we hypothesized that the aliphatic amine employed 
in most antagonists reported to date could be removed if the bicyclic motif of 
the compound scaffold interacted with Asp123 and/or Tyr272 of MCHR1. We excluded 
aliphatic amines from our compound designs, with a cutoff value of pK(a) < 8, 
and explored aliphatic amine-free MCHR1 antagonists in a CNS-oriented chemical 
space limited by four descriptors (TPSA, ClogP, MW, and HBD count). Screening of 
novel bicyclic motifs with high intrinsic binding affinity for MCHR1 identified 
the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine ring (represented in compounds 6a and 6b), and 
subsequent cyclization of the central aliphatic amide linkage led to the 
discovery of a potent, orally bioavailable MCHR1 antagonist 
4-[(4-chlorobenzyl)oxy]-1-(2-cyclopropyl-3-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one 
10a. It exhibited low potential for hERG inhibition and phospholipidosis 
induction as well as sufficient brain concentration to exert antiobesity effects 
in diet-induced obese rats.
