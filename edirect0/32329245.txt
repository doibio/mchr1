Several encouraging pre-clinical results highlight the melanin-concentrating 
hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) as promising target for anti-obesity drug 
development. Currently however, experimentally resolved structures of MCHR1 are 
not available, which complicates rational drug design campaigns. In this study, 
we aimed at developing accurate, homologymodel-based 3D pharmacophores against 
MCHR1. We show that traditional approaches involving docking of known active 
small molecules are hindered by the flexibility of binding pocket residues. 
Instead, we derived three-dimensional pharmacophores from molecular dynamics 
simulations by employing our novel open-source software PyRod. In a 
retrospective evaluation, the generated 3D pharmacophores were highly predictive 
returning up to 35 % of active molecules and showing an early enrichment (EF1) 
of up to 27.6. Furthermore, PyRod pharmacophores demonstrate higher sensitivity 
than ligand-based pharmacophores and deliver structural insights, which are key 
to rational lead optimization.
