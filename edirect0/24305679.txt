BACKGROUND: The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G 
protein-coupled receptor that regulates energy balance and body composition in 
animal models. Inconsistent effects of MCHR1 polymorphisms on energy homeostasis 
in humans may partly be attributable to environmental factors.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(rs133073, rs133074, rs9611386, and rs882111) in the MCHR1 gene on body 
composition as well as energy-related lifestyle factors (diet and physical 
activity). We also examined the effect of gene-lifestyle interactions on body 
composition.
DESIGN: A total of 1153 participants (248 men and 905 women) from the 
cross-sectional Complex Diseases in the Newfoundland Population: Environment and 
Genetics (CODING) study were genotyped by using probe-based chemistry validated 
assays. Diet and physical activity were estimated by using validated frequency 
questionnaires, and body composition was assessed by using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry.
RESULTS: Three polymorphisms (rs9611386, rs882111, and rs133073) were associated 
with differences in body-composition measurements (all P < 0.05). There was an 
interaction between rs9611386 and carbohydrate intake on total mass and waist 
circumference (both P â‰¤ 0.01). There was also an interaction between rs9611386 
and body mass index categories (normal weight, overweight, and obese) on energy 
intakes (P = 0.02). A similar interaction was shown with rs882111 (P = 0.02). 
Interactions were also observed between each of these polymorphisms (rs9611386, 
rs882111, and rs133073) and physical activity score on body-composition 
measurements (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that polymorphisms in the MCHR1 gene are 
associated with differences in body composition and interact with physiologic 
and energy-related lifestyle factors.
