BMS-830216 is a diprotic acid prodrug of two pKa values (<2 and 6.8) with high 
apparent solubility at pH ≥ 7. At ∼ pH 4 solutions of BMS-830216 appear to be 
surface active, in which their surface tension can be reduced from 72 to 65 
dynes when its concentrations is above the critical aggregation concentration 
(CAC∼0.2 mM). Additionally, at this pH, BMS-830216 tends to form liquid 
crystalline phases (at ≥ 2 mg/mL) in acetate buffer when using tris salt. 
Furthermore, after raising the concentration beyond 20 mg/g, formation of 
gel-like dispersions was noted. These gel-like dispersions exhibited a strong 
elastic strength, significantly impacting the dissolution behavior of the tris 
salt. Mechanistically, it is likely that BMS-830216 tris salt in solution first 
forms a lamellar phase followed by formation of a gel phase at higher 
concentrations (≥20 mg/mL). As indicated by SAXS, the lamellar phase formed 
seems to have two d-spacing values (∼5 nm and ∼10 nm (weak), which seems to 
correspond to two molecules connected tail by tail (5 nm). Further investigation 
is needed for phase identification, as their properties can affect the physical 
behavior of BMS-830216 in the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms.
