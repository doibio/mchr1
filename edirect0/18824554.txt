OBJECTIVE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic orexigenic 
neuropeptide that regulates energy balance. However, the distribution of MCH and 
its receptor MCHR1 in tissues other than brain suggested additional, as yet 
unappreciated, roles for this neuropeptide. Based on previous paradigms and the 
presence of MCH in the intestine as well as in immune cells, its potential role 
in gut innate immune responses was examined.
METHODS: In human intestinal xenografts grown in mice, changes in the expression 
of MCH and its receptors following treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin A, 
the causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in hospitalised patients, 
were examined. In colonocytes, the effect of C difficile toxin A treatment on 
MCHR1 expression, and of MCH on interleukin 8 (IL8) expression was examined. 
MCH-deficient mice and immunoneutralisation approaches were used to examine the 
role of MCH in the pathogenesis of C difficile toxin A-mediated acute enteritis.
RESULTS: Upregulation of MCH and MCHR1 expression was found in the human 
intestinal xenograft model, and of MCHR1 in colonocytes following exposure to 
toxin A. Treatment of colonocytes with MCH resulted in IL8 transcriptional 
upregulation, implying a link between MCH and inflammatory pathways. In further 
support of this view, MCH-deficient mice developed attenuated toxin A-mediated 
intestinal inflammation and secretion, as did wild-type mice treated with an 
antibody against MCH or MCHR1.
CONCLUSION: These findings signify MCH as a mediator of C difficile-associated 
enteritis and possibly of additional gut pathogens. MCH may mediate its 
proinflammatory effects at least in part by acting on epithelial cells in the 
intestine.
