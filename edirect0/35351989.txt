Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported substantial genomic loci 
significantly associated with clinical risk of bipolar disorder (BD), and 
studies combining techniques of genetics, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and 
pharmacology are believed to help tackle clinical problems (e.g., identifying 
novel therapeutic targets). However, translating findings of psychiatric 
genetics into biological mechanisms underlying BD pathogenesis remains less 
successful. Biological impacts of majority of BD GWAS risk loci are obscure, and 
the involvement of many GWAS risk genes in this illness is yet to be 
investigated. It is thus necessary to review the progress of applying BD GWAS 
risk genes in the research and intervention of the disorder. A comprehensive 
literature search found that a number of such risk genes had been investigated 
in cellular or animal models, even before they were highlighted in BD GWAS. 
Intriguingly, manipulation of many BD risk genes (e.g., ANK3, CACNA1C, CACNA1B, 
HOMER1, KCNB1, MCHR1, NCAN, SHANK2 etc.) resulted in altered murine behaviors 
largely restoring BD clinical manifestations, including mania-like symptoms such 
as hyperactivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, as well as antidepressant-like 
behavior, and these abnormalities could be attenuated by mood stabilizers. In 
addition to recapitulating phenotypic characteristics of BD, some GWAS risk 
genes further provided clues for the neurobiology of this illness, such as 
aberrant activation and functional connectivity of brain areas in the limbic 
system, and modulated dendritic spine morphogenesis as well as synaptic 
plasticity and transmission. Therefore, BD GWAS risk genes are undoubtedly 
pivotal resources for modeling this illness, and might be translational 
therapeutic targets in the future clinical management of BD. We discuss both 
promising prospects and cautions in utilizing the bulk of useful resources 
generated by GWAS studies. Systematic integrations of findings from genetic and 
neuroscience studies are called for to promote our understanding and 
intervention of BD.
