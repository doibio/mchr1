It was found that 3-(aminomethyl)quinoline derivatives showed high binding 
affinities for melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) with reduced 
affinity for serotonin receptor 2c (5-HT2c) when the dihydronaphthalene nucleus 
of compound 1 (human MCHR1, IC(50) = 1.9 nM; human 5-HT2c receptor, IC(50) = 
0.53 nM) was replaced by other bicyclic core scaffolds. Among the synthesized 
compounds, 8-methylquinoline derivative 5v especially showed high binding 
affinity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM), potent in vitro antagonistic activity (IC(50) = 2.8 
nM) for MCHR1, and negligible affinity for 5-HT2c receptor (IC(50) > 1000 nM). 
Oral administration of 5v significantly and dose-dependently suppressed 
nocturnal food intake in diet-induced obese rats and did not affect food intake 
in MCHR1-deficient mice. These results and rat pharmacokinetic study findings 
suggested that compound 5v is a highly potent, orally bioavailable, and 
centrally acting nonpeptide MCHR1 antagonist.
