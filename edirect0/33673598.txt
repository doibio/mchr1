Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid long peptide found in the 
brain of animals, including fishes, batrachians, and mammals. MCH is implicated 
in appetite and/or energy homeostasis. Antagonists at its receptor (MCH-R1) 
could be major tools (or ultimately drugs) to understand the mechanism of MCH 
action and to fight the obesity syndrome that is a worldwide societal health 
problem. Ever since the deorphanisation of the MCH receptor, we cloned, 
expressed, and characterized the receptor MCH-R1 and started a vast medicinal 
chemistry program aiming at the discovery of such usable compounds. In the 
present final work, we describe GPS18169, a pseudopeptide antagonist at the 
MCH-R1 receptor with an affinity in the nanomolar range and a Ki for its 
antagonistic effect in the 20 picomolar range. Its metabolic stability is rather 
ameliorated compared to its initial parent compound, the antagonist S38151. We 
tested it in an in vivo experiment using high diet mice. GPS18169 was found to 
be active in limiting the accumulation of adipose tissues and, correlatively, we 
observed a normalization of the insulin level in the treated animals, while no 
change in food or water consumption was observed.
