BACKGROUND: Iron-related genes and iron status may independently contribute to 
variable HIV outcomes. The nature of the biologically plausible gene-nutrient 
interaction remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate whether iron-related genotypes 
and clinically abnormal iron status independently predict mortality in HIV and 
whether a gene-nutrient interaction exists.
DESIGN: Baseline plasma, DNA, and clinical data were obtained from 1362 
HIV-seropositive Gambian adults followed for 11.5 y to ascertain all-cause 
mortality. Iron status was estimated on the basis of plasma iron, soluble 
transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, transferrin, transferrin index, and 
log(sTfR/ferritin). One haptoglobin (HP) and 5 SLC11A1 (NRAMP1) polymorphisms 
were genotyped.
RESULTS: SLC11A1-SLC3 and CAAA polymorphisms were the best independent genetic 
predictors of mortality [adjusted mortality rate ratio (95% CI)]: SLC3:G/C = 
0.59 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.85), CAAA:del/ins = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.07). In an 
adjusted model that included all polymorphisms, SLC1:199/199, SLC1:other/other, 
SLC6a:A/A, and CAAA:del/ins were associated with significantly greater 
mortality, whereas Hp 2-1 and SLC3:G/C were protective. In unadjusted analyses, 
all biomarker concentrations were significantly associated with mortality. In an 
extension of previous findings, both low and elevated iron states were 
associated with mortality, but the nature of the risk was variable, with linear, 
inversely linear, and U-shaped associations depending on the biomarker. 
Mortality was significantly lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection in the 
presence of abnormal (low or elevated) iron status. A gene-iron interaction was 
detected (likelihood-ratio test P = 0.018); however, subject numbers restricted 
category-specific interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: Iron-related genes, iron status, and their interaction predict 
mortality in HIV. These findings illustrate the complexity and uncertainty 
surrounding best practice for managing abnormal iron status and anemia during 
HIV infection and in regions with a high risk of infection.
