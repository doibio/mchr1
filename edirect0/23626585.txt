Extensive studies in rodents with melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) have 
demonstrated that the neuropeptide hormone is a potent orexigen. Acutely, MCH 
causes an increase in food intake, while chronically it leads to increased 
weight gain, primarily as an increase in fat mass. Multiple knockout mice models 
have confirmed the importance of MCH in modulating energy homeostasis. Animals 
lacking MCH, MCH-containing neurons, or the MCH receptor all are resistant to 
diet-induced obesity. These genetic and pharmacologic studies have prompted a 
large effort to identify potent and selective MCH receptor antagonists, 
initially as tool compounds to probe pharmacology in models of obesity, with an 
ultimate goal to identify novel anti-obesity drugs. In animal models, MCH 
antagonists have consistently shown efficacy in reducing food intake acutely and 
inhibiting body-weight gain when given chronically. Five compounds have 
proceeded into clinical testing. Although they were reported as well-tolerated, 
none has advanced to long-term efficacy and safety studies.
