Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic 19 amino acid orexigenic 
neuropeptide. The action of MCH on feeding is thought to involve the activation 
of its respective G protein-coupled receptor MCH-R1. Consequently, antagonists 
that block MCH regulated MCH-R1 activity may provide a viable approach to the 
treatment of diet-induced obesity. This communication reports the discovery of a 
novel MCH-R1 receptor antagonist, the biarylether 7, identified through high 
throughput screening. The solid-phase synthesis and structure-activity 
relationship of related analogs is described.
