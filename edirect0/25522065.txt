INTRODUCTION: The cyclic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) shows 
appetite-stimulating effects indicating an involvement in obesity. Large efforts 
have been invested in discovery programs to identify novel MCH1 receptor (MCHR1) 
antagonists. Other indications where MCHR1 antagonists may have a potential use 
include: anxiety/depression and, more recently, inflammatory responses in the 
gastrointestinal tract.
AREAS COVERED: The current review covers the patent literature on MCHR1 
antagonists published from November 2010 to March 2014. The applications have 
been grouped by filing company, and weight has been put on commenting compounds 
with disclosed in vivo biological data.
EXPERT OPINION: Achieving sufficient separation of the human EtheR-a-Go-go 
channel has prevented many programs from reaching the clinic. For clinical 
programs, CNS exposure seems to have been a major challenge. Although clinical 
studies of MCHR1 antagonists have not been able to conclusively evaluate the 
concept, the body of evidence suggesting a role for MCHR1 antagonists in weight 
management is strong and novel chemical series still appear in the patent 
literature. An MCHR1 antagonist with the appropriate physical chemical 
properties is needed to convincingly evaluate the MCHR1 concept for obesity 
treatment and, as knowledge from previous programs are shared, the discovery of 
such a compound should be achievable.
