BACKGROUND: The hypothalamic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) 
plays a critical role in energy homeostasis. Abundant expression of the MCH 
receptor is observed outside the hypothalamus, especially in the dorsal and the 
ventral striatum, raising the possibility that MCH modulates the function of the 
midbrain dopamine neurons and associated circuitry.
METHODS: The MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) expression was assessed by in situ 
hybridization. Expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) and the dopamine D1 and 
D2 receptor (D1R and D2R) subtypes in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and the nucleus 
accumbens (Acb) was evaluated by immunoblotting. Amperometry in ex vivo slices 
of the Acb was used to measure evoked-dopamine release in MCH-/ - mice. 
Catalepsy in MCH+/+ and MCH-/- mice was assessed by the bar test after 
haloperidol injection. Locomotor activity was measured after acute and chronic 
treatment with amphetamine and after dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12909 
administration.
RESULTS: The psychostimulant amphetamine caused enhanced behavioral 
sensitization in MCH-/- mice. We found significantly elevated expression of the 
DAT in the Acb of MCH-/- mice. The DAT-mediated uptake of dopamine was also 
enhanced in MCH-/- mice consistent with increased expression of DAT. We also 
found that evoked dopamine release is significantly increased in the Acb shell 
of MCH-/- mice. The GBR 12909 administration increased the locomotor activity of 
MCH-/- mice significantly above that of MCH+/+ mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that MCH, in addition to its known role 
in feeding and weight regulation, plays a critical role in regulating Acb 
dopamine signaling and related behavioral responses.
