BACKGROUND: Objective parameters to assess disease activity in non-segmental 
vitiligo are lacking. Melanocyte antigen-specific antibodies are frequently 
found in the sera of patients with vitiligo and the presence of these antibodies 
may correlate with disease activity.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between melanocyte antigen-specific 
antibodies and recent disease activity in patients with vitiligo and to evaluate 
the potential usefulness of this objective parameter in daily clinical practice.
METHODS: The prevalence of tyrosinase, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells-1 
(MART1), melanin-concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHR1), gp100 and tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) antibodies was evaluated in 21 patients with non-segmental 
vitiligo and in 20 healthy controls.
RESULTS: In 21 patients, nine (42.8%) showed antibody responses against 
tyrosinase, MART1, MCHR1, gp100 or TH. No antibody responses were found in the 
20 controls. No correlation was found between the presence of antibodies and 
recent disease activity or other clinical characteristics such as age, gender, 
extension and duration of vitiligo.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 42.8% of the vitiligo patients showed an antibody 
response to melanocyte antigen-specific antigens. However, the presence of 
antibodies against melanocytes did not correlate with recent disease activity or 
other relevant disease parameters, and for the moment screening for these 
antibodies in individual patients does not appear to be clinically relevant.
