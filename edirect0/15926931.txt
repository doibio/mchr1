In order to investigate the physiological properties of the 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) we have generated and used mice from which 
the MCH receptor 1 gene was deleted (MCHR1(Neo/Neo) mice). Complementary 
experimental approaches were used to investigate alterations in the learning and 
memory processes of our transgenic model. The ability of the knockout strain to 
carry out the inhibitory passive avoidance test was found to be considerably 
impaired although no significant differences were observed in anxiety levels. 
This impaired cognitive property prompted us to explore modifications in 
N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) responses in the hippocampus. Intracellular 
recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from the 
MCHR1(Neo/Neo) mice revealed significantly decreased NMDA responses. Finally, 
using in situ hybridization we found a 15% reduction in NMDAR1 subunit in the 
CA1 region. These results show for the first time a possible role for MCH in the 
control of the function of the NMDA receptor.
