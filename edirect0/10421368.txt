Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cloned proteins with structural 
characteristics common to the GPCRs but that bind unidentified ligands. Orphan 
GPCRs have been used as targets to identify novel transmitter molecules. Here we 
describe the isolation from brain extracts and the characterization of the 
natural ligand of a particular orphan GPCR (SLC-1) that is sequentially 
homologous to the somatostatin receptors. We show that the natural ligand of 
this receptor is the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). MCH is a 
cyclic peptide that regulates a variety of functions in the mammalian brain, in 
particular feeding behaviour. We demonstrate that nanomolar concentrations of 
MCH strongly activate SLC-1-related pathways through G(alpha)i and/or G(alpha)q 
proteins. We have analysed the tissue localization of the MCH receptor and find 
that it is expressed in several brain regions, in particular those involved in 
olfactory learning and reinforcement mechanisms, indicating that therapies 
targeting the MCH receptor should act on the neuronal regulation of food 
consumption.
