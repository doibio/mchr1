Membrane transporters are integral membrane proteins that mediate the passage of 
solutes across lipid bilayers. These proteins undergo conformational transitions 
between outward- and inward-facing states, which lead to alternating access of 
the substrate-binding site to the aqueous environment on either side of the 
membrane. Dozens of different transporter families have evolved, providing a 
wide variety of structural solutions to achieve alternating access. A sub-set of 
structurally diverse transporters operate by mechanisms that are collectively 
named 'elevator-type'. These transporters have one common characteristic: they 
contain a distinct protein domain that slides across the membrane as a rigid 
body, and in doing so it 'drags" the transported substrate along. Analysis of 
the global conformational changes that take place in membrane transporters using 
elevator-type mechanisms reveals that elevator-type movements can be achieved in 
more than one way. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data help to 
understand how lipid bilayer properties may affect elevator movements and vice 
versa.
