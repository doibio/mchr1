We report here the discovery of a class of MCH R1 ligands based on a biphenyl 
carboxamide template. A docked-in model is presented indicating key interactions 
in the putative binding site of the receptor. Parallel high throughput synthetic 
techniques were utilised to allow rapid exploration of the structure-activity 
relationship around this template, leading to compound SB-568849 which possessed 
good receptor affinity and selectivity. This compound proved to be an antagonist 
with stability in vivo, an acceptable brain-blood ratio and oral 
bioavailability.
