Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) regulates feeding and energy homeostasis 
through interaction with its receptor, the melanin-concentrating receptor 1 
(MCHR1), making it a target in the treatment of obesity. Molecular modeling and 
docking studies were performed in order to find a binding model for the docking 
of two new series of MCHR1 antagonists to the receptor. Results suggested 
interactions between the ligands and two glutamines (Gln5.42 and Gln6.55) not 
conserved in many of the GPCRs family members. Histamine 3 receptor (HRH3) 
presents two apolar residues in the aforementioned positions and the available 
biological data against this receptor supported the role of the two glutamines 
in the binding of antagonists to the MCHR1. This knowledge could be useful in 
the development of new, more active and more selective MCHR1 antagonists.
