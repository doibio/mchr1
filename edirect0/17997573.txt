Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is implicated in the feeding behavior in 
mammals affording a potential target to control overeating in people. Compound 1 
(AMG 076) has been identified as a potent MCHr1 antagonist for the treatment of 
obesity. A synthesis suitable for the large-scale preparation of this lead 
candidate was developed to support preclinical studies. A Robinson annulation of 
benzylpiperidone and resolution of the desired enone from a mixture of the 
diastereomers afforded key intermediate 6 after a stereoselective hydrogenation. 
Subsequent Fischer indole synthesis with hydrazine 5 then provided the advanced 
intermediate, indole 2. Two complementary reductive amination strategies 
employing either aldehyde 3 or lactol 4 led to the synthesis of title compound 
1.
