Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important mediator of energy 
homeostasis and plays a role in metabolic and CNS disorders. The 
modeling-supported design, synthesis and multi-parameter optimization 
(biological activity, solubility, metabolic stability, hERG) of novel 
quinazoline derivatives as MCHR1 antagonists are described. The in vivo proof of 
principle for weight loss with a lead compound from this series is exemplified. 
Clusters of refined hMCHR1 homology models derived from the X-ray structure of 
the β2-adrenergic receptor, including extracellular loops, were developed and 
used to guide the design.
