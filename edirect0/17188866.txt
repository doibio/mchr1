The incorporation of constrained tertiary amines into an existing class of 
N-benzyl-4-aminopiperidinyl chromone-based MCHr1 antagonists led to the 
identification of a series of chiral racemic compounds that displayed good to 
excellent functional potency, binding affinity, and selectivity over the hERG 
channel. Further separation of two distinct chiral racemic compounds into their 
corresponding pairs of enantiomers revealed a considerable selectivity for MCHr1 
for one configuration, in addition to a striking difference in oral exposure 
between one pair of enantiomers in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration 
of the most potent compound in this class in the same animal model led to 
significant reduction of fat mass in a semi-chronic model for weight loss.
