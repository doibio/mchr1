Obesity is growing at an alarming rate with huge consequences on health and 
economy. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled in less than 35 
years. Obesity causes many physiological dysfunctions that affect nearly every 
organ producing multiple morbidities. Despite these facts, there is still no 
clear, well-defined solution. Notwithstanding the devastating prevalence and 
consequences of obesity, today only five medicines, orlistat, lorcaserin, 
phentermine-topiramate, bupropion-naltrexone and liraglutide, are approved by 
the FDA for long-term treatment of obesity. In this review, the current 
approaches to treat obesity such as the development of diacylglycerol 
Oacyltransferase- 1 inhibitors, growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a 
antagonists/inverse agonists, melanocortin-3 receptors agonists and melanin 
concentrating hormone receptor-1 antagonists, will be discussed. The main focus 
will be on the molecules that were able to reach clinical trials. The last 
section is dedicated to the "browning" phenomenon of white adipose tissues and 
the potential of Aldh1a1 inhibitors to treat obesity.
