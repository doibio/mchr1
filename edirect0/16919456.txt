A series of 2-aminoquinoline compounds was prepared and evaluated in MCH1R 
binding and functional antagonist assays. Small dialkyl, methylalkyl, 
methylcycloalkyl, and cyclic amines were tolerated at the quinoline 2-position. 
The in vivo efficacy of compound 12 was explored and compared to that of a 
related inactive analog to determine their effects on food intake and body 
weight in rodents.
