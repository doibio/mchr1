The compelling genetic and pharmacological evidence implicating 
melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor (MCH-1R) signalling in the regulation 
of food intake and energy expenditure has generated a great deal of interest by 
pharmaceutical companies for the discovery of MCH-1R antagonists, evidenced by 
the increased number of patents describing MCH-1R antagonists for the treatment 
of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The structural diversity of small molecular 
weight drug-like MCH-1R antagonists produced and preclinical studies showing 
hypophagia and weight loss with small molecular weight and peptidal antagonists 
in rodents is encouraging and suggests that the identification of clinical 
candidates will be forthcoming.
