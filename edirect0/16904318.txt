The identification of an MCH R1 antagonist screening hit led to the optimization 
of a class of benzimidazole-based MCH R1 antagonists. Structure-activity 
relationships and efforts to optimize pharmacokinetic properties are detailed 
along with the demonstration of the effectiveness of an MCH R1 antagonist in an 
animal model of obesity.
