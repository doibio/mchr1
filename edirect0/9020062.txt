We amplified human genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 
oligonucleotides based on the primary sequence of the genes encoding the 
somatostatin receptors (SSTR) and the somatostatin-like receptor gene SLC-1. One 
resultant DNA fragment was used to screen a genomic DNA library resulting in the 
isolation of a gene, GPR25, encoding an additional member of the G 
protein-coupled receptor family (GPCR). GPR25 is intronless throughout its open 
reading frame (ORF) and encodes a protein of 360 amino acids. The receptor 
encoded by GPR25 shares highest identity to the receptor encoded by GPR15, 
angiotensin II type 1A receptor, and somatostatin receptor 5. Northern analysis 
found no transcripts expressed in liver or any of the 12 brain regions analyzed. 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis localized GPR25 to chromosome 
1q32.1.
