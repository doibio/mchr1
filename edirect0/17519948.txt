BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic 
orexigenic neuropeptide predominantly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus. We 
investigated the roles of MCH1 receptor signalling in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced 
obesity in female C57BL/6J mice, an animal model of postmenopausal obesity.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of blocking signalling via the MCH1 receptor 
on OVX-induced obesity was investigated by using Mch1r deficient (KO) mice and 
chronic treatment with a selective MCH1 receptor antagonist.
KEY RESULTS: OVX induced body weight gain and increases in the weight of 
visceral fat and of liver; these effects were attenuated following OVX in Mch1r 
KO mice. OVX-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation and elevated expression of 
lipogenic genes were significantly ameliorated in the liver of Mch1r KO mice. In 
agreement with these results, chronic i.c.v. infusion of a selective MCH1 
receptor antagonist significantly reduced body weight gain, visceral fat and 
liver weights in OVX mice, and hepatic TG contents and lipogenic gene expression 
levels were normalized.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that MCH1 receptor signalling 
is involved in the development of fatty liver, as well as obesity, in OVX mice, 
and suggest a therapeutic potential for MCH1 receptor antagonists in the 
treatment of obesity and fatty liver.
