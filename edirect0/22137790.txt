A novel series of 4-arylphthalazin-1(2H)-one linked to arylpiperidines were 
synthesized and evaluated as MCH-R1 antagonists. The results of an extensive SAR 
study probing the effects of substituents on the 4-arylphthalazin-1(2H)-one C-4 
aryl group led to the identification of the 4-(3,4-difluorophenyl) derivative as 
a highly potent MCH-R1 inhibitor with an IC(50)=1nM. However, further 
investigations showed that this substance has unacceptable pharmacokinetic 
properties including a high clearance and volume of distribution.
