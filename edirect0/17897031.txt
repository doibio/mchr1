Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic, nonadecapeptide expressed in 
the CNS of all vertebrates that regulates feeding behavior and energy 
homeostasis. The MCH-1 receptor (MCH-R1) has been identified as a key target in 
MCH regulation, as small molecule antagonists of MCH-R1 have demonstrated 
activity in vivo. Herein, we chronicle our efforts to optimize a hit identified 
via high throughput screening of our proprietary compound library. Several 
challenges such as selectivity over other receptors, toxicity of a potential 
metabolite and determining receptor occupancy via a medium throughput assay will 
be reviewed.
