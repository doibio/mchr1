INTRODUCTION: Due to its involvement in a variety of pathologies (obesity, 
diabetes, gut inflammation and depression), the melanin concentrating hormone 
receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a new target for the treatment of these lifestyle 
diseases. We previously presented the radiosynthesis of [(11)C]SNAP-7941, the 
first potential PET tracer for the MCHR1.
METHODS: We herein present its in vitro and in vivo evaluation, including 
binding affinity, plasma stability, stability against liver mircrosomes and 
carboxylesterase, lipohilicity, biodistribution, in vivo metabolism and 
small-animal PET.
RESULTS: [(11)C]SNAP-7941 evinced high stability against liver microsomes, 
carboxylesterase and in human plasma. The first small-animal PET experiments 
revealed a 5 fold increased brain uptake after Pgp/BCRP inhibition. Therefore, 
it can be assumed that [(11)C]SNAP-7941 is a Pgp/BCRP substrate. No metabolites 
were found in brain.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of these experiments with healthy rats, the suitability 
of [(11)C]SNAP-7941 for the visualisation of central and peripheral MCHR1 
remains speculative.
