RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The melanin-concentrating hormone 1 (MCH1) receptors 
play an important role in home-cage food consumption in rodents, but their role 
in operant high-fat food-reinforced responding or reinstatement of food seeking 
in animal models is unknown. Here, we used the MCH1 receptor antagonist SNAP 
94847 to explore these questions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In experiment 1, we trained food-restricted rats (16 
g/day of nutritionally balanced rodent diet) to lever press for high-fat (35%) 
pellets (3-h/day, every other day) for 14 sessions. We then tested the effect of 
SNAP 94847 (3-30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) on food-reinforced operant 
responding. In experiments 2 and 3, we trained rats to lever press for the food 
pellets (9 to 14 3-h sessions) and subsequently extinguished the food-reinforced 
lever responding by removing the food (10 to 17 sessions). We then tested the 
effect of SNAP 94847 on reinstatement of food seeking induced by MCH (20 microg, 
intracerebroventricular), noncontingent delivery of three pellets during the 
first minute of the test session (pellet-priming), contingent tone-light cues 
previously associated with pellet delivery (cue), or the pharmacological 
stressor yohimbine (2 mg/kg, i.p.).
RESULTS: Systemic injections of SNAP 94847 decreased food-reinforced operant 
responding and MCH-induced reinstatement of food seeking. SNAP 94847 had no 
effect on pellet-priming-, cue-, or yohimbine-induced reinstatement.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that MCH1 receptors are involved in 
food-reinforced operant responding but not in reinstatement induced by acute 
exposure to high-fat food, food cues, or the stress-like state induced by 
yohimbine. These results suggest that different mechanisms mediate 
food-reinforced operant responding and reinstatement of food seeking.
