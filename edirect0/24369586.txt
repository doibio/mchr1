Target focused libraries can be rapidly selected by 2D virtual screening methods 
from multimillion compounds' repositories if structures of active compounds are 
available. In the present study a multi-step virtual and in vitro screening 
cascade is reported to select Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor-1 (MCHR1) 
antagonists. The 2D similarity search combined with physicochemical parameter 
filtering is suitable for selecting candidates from multimillion compounds' 
repository. The seeds of the first round virtual screening were collected from 
the literature and commercial databases, while the seeds of the second round 
were the hits of the first round. In vitro screening underlined the efficiency 
of our approach, as in the second screening round the hit rate (8.6 %) 
significantly improved compared to the first round (1.9%), reaching the 
antagonist activity even below 10 nM.
