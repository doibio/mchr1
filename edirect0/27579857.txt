BACKGROUND: Reward and energy homeostasis are both regulated by a network of 
hypothalamic neuropeptide systems. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and 
its MCH-1 receptor (MCH1-R) modulate alcohol intake, but it remains unknown to 
what extent this reflects actions on energy balance or reward. Here, we 
evaluated the MCH1-R in regulation of caloric intake and motivation to consume 
alcohol in states of escalated consumption.
METHODS: Rats had intermittent access (IA) to alcohol and were divided into 
high- and low-drinking groups. Food and alcohol consumption was assessed after 
administration of an MCH1-R antagonist, GW803430. Next, GW803430 was evaluated 
on alcohol self-administration in protracted abstinence induced by IA in 
high-drinking rats. Finally, the effect of GW803430 was assessed on alcohol 
self-administration in acute withdrawal in rats exposed to alcohol vapor. Gene 
expression of MCH and MCH1-R was measured in the hypothalamus and nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) in both acute and protracted abstinence.
RESULTS: High-drinking IA rats consumed more calories from alcohol than chow and 
GW803430 decreased both chow and alcohol intake. In low-drinking rats, only food 
intake was affected. In protracted abstinence from IA, alcohol 
self-administration was significantly reduced by pretreatment with GW803430 and 
gene expression of both MCH and the MCH1-R were dysregulated in hypothalamus and 
NAc. In contrast, during acute withdrawal from vapor exposure, treatment with 
GW803430 did not affect alcohol self-administration, and no changes in MCH or 
MCH1-R gene expression were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a dual role of MCH and the MCH1-R in regulation of 
alcohol intake, possibly through mechanisms involving caloric intake and reward 
motivation. A selective suppression of alcohol self-administration during 
protracted abstinence by GW803430 was observed and accompanied by adaptations in 
gene expression of MCH and MCH1-R. Selective suppression of escalated 
consumption renders the MCH1-R an attractive target for treatment of alcohol use 
disorders.
