Changes in the expression of the melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 
(MCHR1) are involved in a variety of pathologies, especially obesity and anxiety 
disorders. To monitor these pathologies in-vivo positron emission tomography 
(PET) is a suitable method. After the successful radiosynthesis of 
[(11)C]SNAP-7941-the first PET-Tracer for the MCHR1, we aimed to synthesize its 
[(18)F]fluoroethylated analogue: [(18)F]FE@SNAP. Therefore, microfluidic and 
vessel-based approaches were tested. [(18)F]fluoroethylation was conducted via 
various [(18)F]fluoroalkylated synthons and direct [(18)F]fluorination. Only the 
direct [(18)F]fluorination of a tosylated precursor using a flow-through 
microreactor was successful, affording [(18)F]FE@SNAP in 44.3 ± 2.6%.
