Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a cyclic nonadecapeptide, is predominantly 
expressed in mammalian neurons located in the zona incerta and lateral 
hypothalamus. Current interest in MCH relates to its role in the control of 
feeding behaviour. Two receptors for MCH were recently found: MCH-R(1) and 
MCH-R(2). We show here by RT-PCR analysis and immunofluorescence studies that 
the human neuroblastoma cell line Kelly expresses MCH and MCH-R(1) but not 
MCH-R(2). In competition assays using 125I-labelled MCH an inhibitory 
concentration 50% (IC(50)) of 76nM was determined for MCH, indicating a high 
affinity of Kelly cells for MCH. MCH induces mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) phosphorylation in Kelly cells but no increase in the intracellular free 
Ca(2+) concentration. This suggests that MCH signals via Galpha(i)/Galpha(0) in 
these cells. The presence and functionality of MCH-R(1) renders this neuronal 
cell a very useful model for future structure-activity studies in a 
physiological environment mimicking the human brain for the evaluation of 
potential appetite-regulating drugs.
