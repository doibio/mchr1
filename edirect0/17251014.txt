Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) plays an important role in the regulation of 
food intake and energy balance in mammals. MCH-1 receptor (MCH1R) deficient mice 
are lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity. As such, MCH1R antagonists are 
believed to have potential as possible treatments for obesity. The discovery of 
a novel class of tetralin ureas as potent MCH1R antagonists is described herein.
