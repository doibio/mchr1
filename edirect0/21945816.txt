In order to better understand the role of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in 
the regulation of appetite in fish, the mRNAs of two forms of MCH, prepro-MCH 
and MCH2, and two forms of MCH receptors, MCH-R1 and MCH-R2, were isolated from 
winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). In addition, the mRNA 
expressions of these peptides and their receptors were determined under fed and 
fasted conditions. Both MCHs are expressed in forebrain and midbrain, as well as 
peripheral tissues including gut and gonads. Both MCH-Rs are ubiquitously 
expressed in the brain and periphery. Fasting induced an increase in the 
expression levels of MCH and MCH-R1 mRNAs in optic tectum/thalamus and 
hypothalamus but had no effect on either MCH2 or MCH-R2 mRNA expressions. Our 
results suggest that MCH and MCH-R1, but not MCH2 and MCH-R2 might have a role 
in the regulation of appetite in flounder.
