An initial SAR study resulted in the identification of the novel, potent MCHR1 
antagonist 2. After further profiling, compound 2 was discovered to be a potent 
inhibitor of the hERG potassium channel, which prevented its further 
development. Additional optimization of this structure resulted in the discovery 
of the potent MCHR1 antagonist 11 with a dramatically reduced hERG liability. 
The decrease in hERG activity was confirmed by several in vivo preclinical 
cardiovascular studies examining QT prolongation. This compound demonstrated 
good selectivity for MCHR1 and possessed good pharmacokinetic properties across 
preclinical species. Compound 11 was also efficacious in reducing body weight in 
two in vivo mouse models. This compound was selected for clinical evaluation and 
was given the code AMG 076.
