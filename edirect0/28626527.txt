In this study, we report a ligand-centric data mining approach that guided the 
identification of suitable target profiles for treating obesity. The newly 
developed method is based on identifying target pairs for synergistic positive 
effects and also encompasses the exclusion of compounds showing a detrimental 
effect on obesity treatment (off-targets). Ligands with known activity against 
obesity-relevant targets were compared using fingerprint representations. 
Similar compounds with activities to different targets were evaluated for the 
mechanism of action since activation or deactivation of drug targets determines 
the pharmacological effect. In vitro validation of the modeling results revealed 
that three known modulators of melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) 
show a previously unknown submicromolar affinity to the histamine H3 receptor 
(H3R). This synergistic activity may present a novel therapeutic option against 
obesity.
