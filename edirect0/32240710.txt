GPCRs are the largest family of receptors accounting for about 30% of the 
current drug targets. However, it is difficult to fully elucidate the mechanisms 
regulating intracellular GPCR signal regulation. It is thus important to 
consider and investigate GPCRs with respect to endogenous situations. Our group 
has been investigating GPCRs involved in body color (teleost and amphibian) and 
eating (vertebrate). Here, I review two independent GPCR systems (heterodimer 
formation and primary ciliated GPCR) that can be breakthroughs in GPCR research. 
In teleosts, MCRs form heterodimers, which significantly reduce their affinity 
for acetylated ligands. In mammals, MCHR1 is localized in the ciliary membrane 
and shortens the length of the primary cilia through a unique signal from the 
ciliary membrane. Considering these two new GPCR concepts is expected to advance 
the overall view of the GPCR system.
