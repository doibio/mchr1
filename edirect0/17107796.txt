A direct correlation between hERG binding and QTc prolongation was established 
for a series of aminomethyl tetrahydronaphthalene ketopiperazine MCH-R1 
antagonists. Compounds within this class with greater selectivity over hERG were 
developed. Compound 4h proved to have the best profile, with MCH-R1 Ki = 16 nm 
and hERG IC50 = 25 microM.
