Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important mediator of energy 
homeostasis and plays role in several disorders such as obesity, stress, 
depression and anxiety. The synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 
benzimidazole derivatives as MCHR1 antagonists are described. The in vivo proof 
of principle for weight loss with a lead compound from this series is 
exemplified.
