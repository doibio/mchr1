We report the identification of a gene, named SLC-1(1), encoding a novel G 
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). A customized search procedure of a database of 
expressed sequence tags (dbEST) retrieved a human cDNA sequence that partially 
encoded a GPCR. A genomic DNA fragment identical to the cDNA was obtained and 
used to screen a library to isolate the full-length coding region of the gene. 
This gene was intronless in its open reading frame, and encoded a receptor of 
402 amino acids, and shared -40% amino acid identity in the transmembrane (TM) 
regions to the five known human somatostatin receptors. Northern blot analysis 
revealed that SLC-1 is expressed in human brain regions, including the forebrain 
and hypothalamus. Expression in the rat was highest in brain, followed by heart, 
kidney, and ovary. Expression of SLC-1 in COS-7 cells failed to show specific 
binding to radiolabelled Tyr1-somatostatin-14, naloxone, bremazocine, 
1,3-di(2-tolyl)-guanidine (DTG), or haloperidol. A repeat polymorphism of the 
form (CA)n was discovered in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene and 
SLC-1 was mapped to chromosome 22, q13.3.
