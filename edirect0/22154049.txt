OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular etiologic causes of sporadic 
nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese children.
METHODS: 179 sporadic nonsyndromic hearing loss children were subjected to 
microarray-based mutation detection for nine hot spot mutations in four of the 
most common deafness-related genes, including GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3, and 12s rRNA.
RESULTS: The incidence of positive genetic errors was 43.58% with the current 
set of target genes in sporadic nonsyndromic hearing loss children. Among them, 
25.14% of cases had genetic defects in GJB2, 16.76% of cases had pathogenic 
mutations in SLC26A4, 1.12% of cases were caused by 12s rRNA mutations, and GJB3 
mutation was detected in 0.56% of this group of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that genetic factors were important causes 
for sporadic nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese pediatric cases. Mutations of 
GJB2 and SLC26A4 are two major genetic causes, whereas mutations of GJB3 and 12s 
rRNA result in the development of hearing loss in a small percentage of sporadic 
nonsyndromic hearing loss cases. Microarray testing is a helpful and 
instrumental screening method in the diagnosis of genetic hearing loss.
