Infants undergo extensive developments during their first year of life. Although 
the biological mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood, changes in the 
DNA methylation in mammals are believed to play a key role. This study was 
designed to investigate changes in infant DNA methylation that occurs between 6 
and 52 weeks. A total of 214 infant saliva samples from 6 or 52 weeks were 
assessed using principal component analyses and t-distributed stochastic 
neighbor-embedding algorithms. Between the two time points, there were clear 
differences in DNA methylation. To further investigate these findings, paired 
two-sided student's t-tests were performed. Differently methylated regions were 
defined as at least two consecutive probes that showed significant differences, 
with a q-value < 0.01 and a mean difference > 0.2. After correcting for false 
discovery rates, changes in the DNA methylation levels were found in 42 genes. 
Of these, 36 genes showed increased and six decreased DNA methylation. The 
overall DNA methylation changes indicated decreased gene expression. This was 
surprising because infants undergo such profound developments during their first 
year of life. The results were evaluated by taking into consideration the 
extensive development that occurs during pregnancy. During the first year of 
life, infants have an overall three-fold increase in weight, while the fetus 
develops from a single cell into a viable infant in 9 months, with an 
875-million-fold increase in weight. It is possible that the findings represent 
a biological slowing mechanism in response to extensive fetal development. In 
conclusion, our study provides evidence of DNA methylation changes during the 
first year of life, representing a possible biological slowing mechanism. We 
encourage future studies of DNA methylation changes in infants to replicate the 
findings by using a repeated measures model and less stringent criteria to see 
if the same genes can be found, as well as investigating whether other genes are 
involved in development during this period.
