Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an attractive target for antiobesity 
agents, and numerous drug discovery programs are dedicated to finding 
small-molecule MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonists. We recently reported novel 
pyridine-2(1H)-ones as aliphatic amine-free MCHR1 antagonists that structurally 
featured an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based bicyclic motif. To investigate 
imidazopyridine variants with lower basicity and less potential to inhibit 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), we designed pyridine-2(1H)-ones bearing various 
less basic bicyclic motifs. Among these, a lead compound 6a bearing a 
1H-benzimidazole motif showed comparable binding affinity to MCHR1 to the 
corresponding imidazopyridine derivative 1. Optimization of 6a afforded a series 
of potent thiophene derivatives (6q-u); however, most of these were found to 
cause time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4. As bioactivation of thiophenes 
to form sulfoxide or epoxide species was considered to be a major cause of 
CYP3A4 TDI, we introduced electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene and found 
that a CF3 group on the ring or a Cl adjacent to the sulfur atom helped prevent 
CYP3A4 TDI. Consequently, 
4-[(5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)methoxy]-1-(2-cyclopropyl-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one 
(6s) was identified as a potent MCHR1 antagonist without the risk of CYP3A4 TDI, 
which exhibited a promising safety profile including low CYP3A4 inhibition and 
exerted significant antiobesity effects in diet-induced obese F344 rats.
