RATIONALE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is involved in regulation of 
appetitive behaviors as well as emotional reactivity and reward, behavioral 
domains relevant to alcohol addiction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effects of the non-peptide MCH1 receptor 
antagonist, GW803430 
[6-(4-chloro-phenyl)-3-[3-methoxy-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-3H-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one; 
3-30 mg/kg, i.p.] on alcohol-related behaviors in Wistar rats.
RESULTS: Ex vivo binding experiments demonstrated that the GW803430 dose range 
used resulted in high central MCH1 receptor occupancy. Alcohol 
self-administration was dose-dependently and potently suppressed, by 
approximately 80% at the highest dose. Reinstatement of alcohol-seeking induced 
by alcohol-associated cues was essentially eliminated. In contrast, 
reinstatement induced by footshock stress was not significantly altered. Taste 
preference for a quinine/saccharin solution, locomotor activity, and alcohol 
elimination were unaffected.
CONCLUSION: Together, these observations support a specific involvement of the 
MCH system in mediating alcohol reward and cue-induced relapse to alcohol 
seeking. MCH1-R antagonism may constitute an attractive treatment target for 
alcohol use disorders.
