Gene-knockout studies of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and its effect on 
feeding and energy balance have firmly established MCH as an orexigenic 
(appetite-stimulating) peptide hormone. Here we identify MCH as the ligand for 
the orphan receptor SLC-1. The rat SLC-1 is activated by nanomolar 
concentrations of MCH and is coupled to the G protein G alpha i/o. The pattern 
of SLC-1 messenger RNA expression coincides with the distribution of 
MCH-containing nerve terminals and is consistent with the known central effects 
of MCH. Our identification of an MCH receptor could have implications for the 
development of new anti-obesity therapies.
