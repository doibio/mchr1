RATIONALE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is involved in the regulation of 
food intake and has recently been associated with alcohol-related behaviors. 
Blockade of MCH-1 receptors (MCH1-Rs) attenuates operant alcohol 
self-administration and decreases cue-induced reinstatement, but the mechanism 
through which the MCH1-R influences these behaviors remains unknown. MCH1-Rs are 
highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) where they are 
co-expressed with dopamine (DA) receptors. MCH has been shown to potentiate 
responses to dopamine and to increase phosphorylation of DARPP-32, an 
intracellular marker of DA receptor activation, in the NAcSh.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the role of the MCH1-R in alcohol 
reward using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. We then used 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess activation of downstream signaling after 
administration of a rewarding dose of alcohol.
RESULTS: We found that alcohol-induced CPP was markedly decreased in mice with a 
genetic deletion of the MCH1-R as well as after pharmacological treatment with 
an MCH1-R antagonist, GW803430. In contrast, an isocaloric dose of dextrose did 
not produce CPP. The increase in DARPP-32 phosphorylation seen in wildtype (WT) 
mice after acute alcohol administration in the NAcSh was markedly reduced in 
MCH1-R knock-out (KO) mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MCH1-Rs regulate the rewarding properties 
of alcohol through interactions with signaling cascades downstream of DA 
receptors in the NAcSh.
