The discovery and optimization of piperidin-4-yl-urea derivatives as MCH-R1 
antagonists is herein described. Previous work around the piperidin-4-yl-amides 
led to the discovery of potent MCH-R1 antagonists. However, high affinity 
towards the hERG potassium channel proved to be an issue. Different strategies 
to increase hERG selectivity were implemented and resulted in the identification 
of piperidin-4-yl-urea compounds as potent MCH-R1 antagonists with minimized 
hERG inhibition.
