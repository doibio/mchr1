A substituted 4-aminopiperidine was identified as showing activity in an MCH 
assay from an HTS effort. Subsequent structural modification of the scaffold led 
to the identification of a number of active MCH antagonists. 
3,5-Dimethoxy-N-(1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-yl)benzamide (5c) was 
among those with the highest binding affinity to the MCH receptor (K(i)=27nM), 
when variations were made at benzoyl and naphthylmethyl substitution sites from 
the initial HTS hit. Further optimization via piperidine ring contraction 
resulted in enhanced MCH activity in a 3-aminopyrrolidine series, where 
(R)-3,5-dimethoxy-N-(1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidin-3-yl)benzamide (10i) 
was found to be an excellent MCH antagonist (K(i)=7nM).
