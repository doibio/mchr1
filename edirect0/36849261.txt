Primary cilia are cellular appendages critical for diverse types of Signaling. 
They are found on most cell types, including cells throughout the CNS. Cilia 
preferentially localize certain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are 
critical for mediating the signaling of these receptors. Several of these 
neuronal GPCRs have recognized roles in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. 
Cell and model systems, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Chlamydomonas, have 
implicated both dynamic GPCR cilia localization and cilia length and shape 
changes as key for signaling. It is unclear whether mammalian ciliary GPCRs use 
similar mechanisms in vivo and under what conditions these processes may occur. 
Here, we assess two neuronal cilia GPCRs, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 
1 (MCHR1) and neuropeptide-Y receptor 2 (NPY2R), as mammalian model ciliary 
receptors in the mouse brain. We test the hypothesis that dynamic localization 
to cilia occurs under physiological conditions associated with these GPCR 
functions. Both receptors are involved in feeding behaviors, and MCHR1 is also 
associated with sleep and reward. Cilia were analyzed with a computer-assisted 
approach allowing for unbiased and high-throughput analysis. We measured cilia 
frequency, length, and receptor occupancy. We observed changes in ciliary 
length, receptor occupancy, and cilia frequency under different conditions for 
one receptor but not another and in specific brain regions. These data suggest 
that dynamic cilia localization of GPCRs depends on properties of individual 
receptors and cells where they are expressed. A better understanding of 
subcellular localization dynamics of ciliary GPCRs could reveal unknown 
molecular mechanisms regulating behaviors like feeding.
