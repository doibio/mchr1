Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) has attracted considerable attention because 
of its effects on food intake and body weight and the MCH receptor (MCHR1) 
remains one of the viable targets for obesity therapy. This review summarizes 
the literature examining the effects of MCH on body weight, food intake and 
energy expenditure in rodent models, and the central sites where MCH acts in 
regulating energy homeostasis. Emphasis is given on the discrepancies between 
the genetic and pharmacologic models of MCHR1 inactivation. We propose some 
solutions to resolve these discrepancies and discuss some future directions in 
MCH research.
