BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigen, and 
while rodents express one MCH receptor (MCH1 receptor), humans, non-human 
primates and dogs express two MCH receptors (MCH1 and MCH2 ). MCH1 receptor 
antagonists have been developed for the treatment of obesity and lower body 
weight in rodents. However, the mechanisms for the body weight loss and whether 
MCH1 receptor antagonism can lower body weight in species expressing both MCH 
receptors are not fully understood.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A novel recently identified potent MCH1 receptor 
antagonist, AZD1979, was studied in wild type and Mchr1 knockout (KO) mice and 
by using pair-feeding and indirect calorimetry in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. 
The effect of AZD1979 on body weight was also studied in beagle dogs.
KEY RESULTS: AZD1979 bound to MCH1 receptors in the CNS and dose-dependently 
reduced body weight in DIO mice leading to improved homeostasis model 
assessment-index of insulin sensitivity. AZD1979 did not affect food intake or 
body weight in Mchr1 KO mice demonstrating specificity for the MCH1 receptor 
mechanism. In DIO mice, initial AZD1979-mediated body weight loss was driven by 
decreased food intake, but an additional component of preserved energy 
expenditure was apparent in pair-feeding and indirect calorimetry studies. 
AZD1979 also dose-dependently reduced body weight in dogs.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: AZD1979 is a novel potent MCH1 receptor antagonist 
that affects both food intake and energy expenditure. That AZD1979 also lowers 
body weight in a species expressing both MCH receptors holds promise for the use 
of MCH1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of human obesity.
