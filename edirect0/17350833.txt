Antimicrobial peptides have been recognized as a novel class of antibiotics, and 
several candidates are currently in clinical trials. In this work, a tripeptide 
derivative containing 4-iodo phenylalanine has been derivatized through the 
Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. This has enabled the rapid and efficient 
synthesis of an array of tripeptide derivatives encompassing novel biaryl 
moieties. The peptide derivatives show high activity against Gram-positive 
bacteria.
