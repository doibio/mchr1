Success in discovering bioactive peptide mimetics is often limited by the 
difficulties in correctly transposing known binding elements of the active 
peptide onto a small and metabolically more stable scaffold while maintaining 
bioactivity. Here we describe a scanning approach using a library of 
pyranose-based peptidomimetics that is structurally diverse in a systematic 
manner, designed to cover all possible conformations of tripeptide motifs 
containing two aromatic groups and one positive charge. Structural diversity was 
achieved by efficient selection of various chemoforms, characterized by a choice 
of pyranose scaffold of defined chirality and substitution pattern. A systematic 
scanning library of 490 compounds was thus designed, produced, and screened in 
vitro for activity at the somatostatin (sst(1-5)) and melanin-concentrating 
hormone (MCH(1)) receptors. Bioactive compounds were found for each target, with 
specific chemoform preferences identified in each case, which can be used to 
guide follow-on drug discovery projects without the need for scaffold hopping.
