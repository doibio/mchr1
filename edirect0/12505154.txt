Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is known to act through two 
G-protein-coupled receptors MCHR1 and MCHR2. MCHR1 has three potential sites 
(Asn13, Asn16 and Asn23) for N-linked glycosylation in its extracellular 
amino-terminus which may modulate its reactivity. Site-directed mutagenesis of 
the rat MCHR1 cDNA at single or multiple combinations of the three potential 
glycosylation sites was used to examine the role of the putative carbohydrate 
chains on receptor activity. It was found that all three potential N-linked 
glycosylation sites in MCHR1 were glycosylated, and that N-linked glycosylation 
of Asn23 was necessary for full activity. Furthermore, disruption of all three 
glycosylation sites impaired proper expression at the cell surface and receptor 
activity. These data outline the importance of the N-linked glycosylation of the 
MCHR1.
