The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) has been identified as a B 
cell autoantigen in vitiligo with antibodies to the receptor detectable in 
binding and function-blocking assays. Two epitope domains (amino acids 1-138 and 
139-298) have been previously identified. In this study, we aimed to further 
define the epitope specificity of MCHR1 antibodies using phage-display 
technology and to identify the epitopes recognised by receptor antibodies 
detected in MCHR1 function-blocking assays. Antibody reactivity to MCHR1 
peptides 51-80, 85-98, 154-158 and 254-260 was identified by phage-display and 
subsequently confirmed in phage ELISA in 2/12, 5/12, 3/12 and 6/12 of vitiligo 
patients, respectively. The results suggest that major autoantibody epitopes are 
localised in the 85-98 and 254-260 amino acid regions of MCHR1 with minor 
epitopes in amino acid sequences 51-80 and 154-158. Antibodies with MCHR1 
function-blocking activity were determined to recognise epitope 254-260, this 
being the first epitope to be reported as a target site for antibodies that 
block the function of the receptor.
