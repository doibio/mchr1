Novel phenethylpyridone derivatives were identified as potent human 
melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor (MCH-1R) antagonists. A search for 
surrogates for the 4-(2-aminoethoxy)phenyl moiety of 1 resulted in discovery of 
2-[4-(aminomethyl)phenyl]ethyl substructure as in 6a. Successive optimization of 
the right-hand moiety led to the identification of a number of potent 
derivatives.
