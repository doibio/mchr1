Structure-activity relationships of a 4-aminoquinoline MCH1R antagonist lead 
series were explored by synthesis of analogs with modifications at the 2-, 4-, 
and 6-positions of the original HTS hit. Improvements to the original screening 
lead included lipophilic groups at the 2-position and biphenyl, cyclohexyl 
phenyl, and hydrocinnamyl carboxamides at the 6-position. Modifications of the 
4-amino group were not well tolerated.
