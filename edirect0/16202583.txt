Herein, we report the discovery of the potent and selective biaryl diamide 
derived MCH-R1 receptor antagonist 1, which was identified upon modification of 
a previously disclosed biaryl urea series. This paper describes one of the 
strategies incorporated to remove the highly mutagenic biarylaniline present in 
an otherwise promising biaryl urea series.
