The mammalian neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone, interacts with two G 
protein-coupled receptors, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) 1 and 
MCHR2; however, only MCHR1 is expressed in rats and mice. In the present study, 
we evaluated MCHR1 antagonism in preclinical models believed to be predictive of 
antiobesity and antidepressant activity. Central activity of the selective MCHR1 
antagonist, GW803430 
[6-(4-chloro-phenyl)-3-[3-methoxy-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-3H-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one], 
was evaluated using ex vivo binding with autoradiography. Effective doses of 
GW803430 (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.) were correlated with antiobesity activity in a 
14-day study of diet-induced obese rats. GW803430 was evaluated subsequently for 
antidepressant-like effects in mice and rats. Acute and subchronic 
administration reduced immobility time in the mouse forced-swim test at doses of 
3 (acute) and 3 and 10 (chronic) mg/kg p.o., an effect that was absent in 
MCHR1(-/-) mice. Combined subeffective doses of GW803430 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg p.o.) 
and imipramine (5 mg/kg) produced a robust antidepressant-like response. The 
compound was also active in the tail suspension test at a dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. 
GW803430 (30 mg/kg p.o.) significantly reduced submissive behaviors at weeks 2 
and 3, a model of submissive behavior that may predict antidepressant onset. 
GW803430 decreased marble burying in mice at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg p.o., 
an assay that detects anxiolytic-like effects. Thus, GW803430 produces robust 
antiobesity and antidepressant-like effects in rats and mice at doses that 
compete for central MCHR1 in vivo. As such, MCHR1 should be considered as a 
promising target for future drug discovery efforts.
