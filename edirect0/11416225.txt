Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide expressed in central and 
peripheral nervous systems, plays an important role in the control of feeding 
behaviors and energy metabolism. An orphan G protein-coupled receptor 
(SLC-1/GPR24) has recently been identified as a receptor for MCH (MCHR1). We 
report here the identification and characterization of a G protein-coupled 
receptor as the MCH receptor subtype 2 (MCHR2). MCHR2 has higher protein 
sequence homology to MCHR1 than any other G protein-coupled receptor. The 
expression of MCHR2 has been detected in many regions of the brain. In contrast 
to MCHR1, which is intronless in the coding region and is located at the 
chromosomal locus 22q13.3, the MCHR2 gene has multiple exons and is mapped to 
locus 6q21. MCHR2 is specifically activated by nanomolar concentrations of MCH, 
binds to MCH with high affinity, and signals through Gq protein. This discovery 
is important for a full understanding of MCH biology and the development of 
potential therapeutics for diseases involving MCH, including obesity.
