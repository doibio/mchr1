Mch1r-deficient (Mch1r(-/-)) mice are hyperphagic, hyperactive, lean, and 
resistant to diet-induced obesity. To examine whether the MCH1R is involved in 
regulating activity-based energy expenditure, we investigated voluntary wheel 
running (WR) activity of wild-type (WT) and Mch1r(-/-) mice basally, in response 
to diets with different caloric density and with different feeding schedules. We 
also evaluated WR activity of mice with ablation of the prepro-MCH gene 
(Pmch(-/-) mice). Dark cycle WR activity of Mch1r(-/-) mice fed low fat (LF) 
chow was increased significantly relative to WT mice. Transition to moderate 
high-fat (MHF) diet was associated with an increase in nocturnal WR activity in 
both genotypes. Both Mch1r(-/-) and WT mice exhibited food anticipatory activity 
(FAA) before the daily scheduled feeding time, indicating that MCH1R is not 
required for FAA. Naloxone (3 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed WR activity of both 
genotypes, suggesting opioid regulation of locomotor activity. WR increased 
nocturnal dynorphin mRNA levels in Mch1r(-/-) brain. Importantly, Pmch-deficient 
mice had significantly enhanced WR activity relative to WT controls. These 
results suggest that endogenous MCH plays an inhibitory role in regulating 
locomotor activity. In summary, we demonstrated enhanced WR activities in mice 
lacking either MCH or its cognate receptor.
