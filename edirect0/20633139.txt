Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) highly expressed in the central nervous system. MCHR1 mediates many 
physiological functions including energy homeostasis and emotional processing. 
By acting as GTPase-activating proteins, regulators of G protein-signaling (RGS) 
proteins are negative modulators of GPCRs. We previously elucidated that RGS8 of 
the B/R4 RGS subfamily potently inhibits the action of both Galphaq- and 
Galphai/o-dependent MCHR1 signaling. In the present study of living cells, we 
provide evidence that another B/R4 protein, RGS2, is an efficient regulator of 
MCHR1-mediated calcium signaling exclusively via the Galphaq-dependent pathway. 
This effect was not observed for RGS4 and RGS5 proteins. Cotransfection of RGS2 
with RGS8 additively increased the potency for inhibition of MCHR1 signaling. 
Truncation experiments revealed that an internal sequence within the N-terminal 
region of RGS2 (amino acids 28-80) was involved in the RGS2 modulation of MCHR1 
activity. Our data suggest that RGS2 and RGS8 differentially associate with 
MCHR1 and may represent two distinct modes of signaling mechanisms in vivo.
