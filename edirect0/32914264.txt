Neuropeptides are important, multifunctional regulatory factors of the nervous 
system, being considered as a novel, atypical sites of antidepressants action. 
It has already been proven that some of them, such as selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), are able to affect peptidergic pathways in various 
brain regions. Despite these reports, there is so far no reports regarding the 
effect of treatment with SSRIs on brain proopiomelanocortin (POMC), kisspeptin, 
Kiss1R and MCHR1 gene expression. In the current study we examined POMC, 
kisspeptin, Kiss1R and MCHR1 mRNA expression in the selected brain structures 
(hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, cerebellum and brainstem) of 
rats chronically treated with a 10 mg/kg dose of escitalopram using quantitative 
Real-Time PCR. Long-term treatment with escitalopram led to the upregulation of 
MCHR1 expression in the rat amygdala. Kisspeptin mRNA level was also increased 
in the amygdala, but Kiss1R mRNA expressions were elevated in the hippocampus, 
hypothalamus and cerebellum. POMC mRNA expressions were in turn decreased in the 
hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and brainstem. These results may support the 
hypothesis that these neuropeptides may be involved in the site-dependent 
actions of SSRI antidepressants. This is the first report of the effects of 
escitalopram on POMC, kisspeptin, Kiss1R and MCHR1 in animal brain. Our findings 
shed a new light on the pharmacology of SSRIs and may contribute to a better 
understanding of the alternative, neuropeptide-dependent modes of antidepressant 
action.
