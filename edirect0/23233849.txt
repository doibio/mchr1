Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) that plays an important role in feeding by coupling to Gα(q)- and 
Gα(i)-mediated signal transduction pathways. To interrogate the molecular basis 
for MCHR1 activation, we analyzed the effect of a series of site-directed 
mutations on rat MCHR1 function. In the highly conserved NPxxY(x)(5,6)F domain 
of GPCRs, the phenylalanine residue is involved in structural constraints; 
replacement with alanine generally leads to impaired/lost GPCR function. 
However, Phe-to-Ala (F318A) mutation in MCHR1 had no significant effect on the 
level of cell surface expression and receptor signaling. By analyzing a further 
series of mutants, we found that Phe-to-Lys substitution (F318K) caused the most 
significant reduction in the EC(50) value of MCH for calcium mobilization 
without affecting receptor expression at the cell surface. Interestingly, 
GTPγS-binding, which monitors Gα(i) activation, was not modulated by F318K. Our 
results, combined with computer modeling, provide new insight into the role of 
Phe in the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F motif as a structurally critical site for receptor 
dynamics and a determinant of Gα protein interaction.
