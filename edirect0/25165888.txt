Identification of MCHR1 antagonists with a preclinical safety profile to support 
clinical evaluation as antiobesity agents has been a challenge. Our finding that 
a basic moiety is not required for MCHR1 antagonists to achieve high affinity 
allowed us to explore structures less prone to off-target activities such as 
hERG inhibition. We report the SAR evolution of hydroxylated thienopyrimidinone 
ethers culminating in the identification of 27 (BMS-819881), which entered 
obesity clinical trials as the phosphate ester prodrug 35 (BMS-830216).
