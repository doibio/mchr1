An encoded combinatorial library based on aryl and biaryl piperidine scaffolds 
was designed and synthesized. Screening of this library resulted in the 
discovery of high-nanomolar biaryl piperidine-based MCH1 receptor antagonists. 
Follow-up optimization using a parallel synthesis provided potent, single digit 
nanomolar antagonists.
