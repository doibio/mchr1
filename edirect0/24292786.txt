The discovery that novel naphtho[1,2-b]furan-2-carboxamides containing linked 
piperidinylphenylacetamide groups serve as melanin concentrating hormone 
receptor 1 (MCH-R1) antagonists is described. An extensive structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) study, probing members of this family that contain a variety 
of aryl and heteroaryl groups at C-5 of the naphtho[1,2-b]furan-2-carboxamide 
skeleton and having different chain linker lengths, led to the identification of 
the 5-(4-pyridinyl) substituted analog 10b as a highly potent MCH-R1 antagonist 
with an IC50 value of 3 nM. This substance also displays good metabolic 
stability and it does not significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
enzymes. However, 10b has unacceptable oral bioavailability.
