Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is involved in regulation of food intake and 
energy homeostasis. Antagonists of the MCH receptor are expected to affect food 
intake and weight gain, making MCH-R1 an attractive target for obesity 
treatment. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel, orally active series of 
MCH-R1 antagonists that exhibit in vivo efficacy in rodent obesity models.
