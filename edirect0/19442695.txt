To date, there is a dearth of evidence to support functions for 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptors 
(MCH-R) in mammalian skin physiology including pigmentation, inflammation and 
immune responses and skin cell proliferation. Much research is therefore still 
needed to define the roles of the hormone and its receptors in mammalian skin. 
This will be a crucial step to identifying pathogenic mechanisms that may 
involve the MCH/MCH-R system in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune skin 
diseases as well as skin cancers. The following review summarizes the studies 
which have been carried out to examine the expression and function of MCH and 
MCH-R in mammalian skin. Recent findings with regard to humoral immune responses 
to the MCH-R1 in patients with the skin depigmenting disease vitiligo are also 
discussed.
