Prior SAR studies on 2-amino-8-alkoxyquinoline MCHr1 antagonists demonstrated 
that compounds with acyclic amide-containing sidechains displayed exceptional 
binding and functional potency, but negligible CNS penetration. Related analogs 
with acyclic benzylamine-containing sidechains showed greatly improved CNS 
exposure, but suffered in functional potency. In this report, we demonstrate 
that cyclization of these benzylic amine sidechains affords compounds that 
combine the best elements of potency and CNS penetration among this class of 
antagonists. This is exemplified by compound 21, which has sub-nanomolar MCHr1 
binding affinity, good functional potency, and excellent CNS exposure over 24h.
