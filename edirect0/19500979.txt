Herein, we disclose the discovery and optimization of 2-piperidin-4-yl-acetamide 
derivatives as MCH-R1 antagonists. Structural investigation of 
piperidin-4-yl-amide and piperidin-4-yl-ureas identified 
2-piperidin-4-yl-acetamide-based MCH-R1 antagonists with outstanding in vivo 
efficacy but flawed with high affinity towards the hERG potassium channel. While 
existing hERG SAR information was employed to discover highly potent MCH-R1 
antagonists with minimized hERG inhibition, additional hurdles prevented their 
subsequent clinical exploration.
