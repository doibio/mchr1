Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19-amino-acid cyclic peptide which was 
originally found to lighten skin color in fish that is highly conserved among 
many species. MCH interacts with two G-protein-coupled receptors, MCH1R and 
MCH2R, but only MCH1R is expressed in rodents. MCH is mainly synthesized in the 
lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta, while MCH1R is widely expressed 
throughout the brain. Thus, MCH signaling is implicated in the regulation of 
many physiological functions. The identification of MCH1R has led to the 
development of small-molecule MCH1R antagonists that can block MCH signaling. 
MCH1R antagonists are useful not only for their potential therapeutic value, but 
also for understanding the physiological functions of the endogenous MCH system. 
Here, we review the physiological functions of the MCH system which have been 
investigated using MCH1R antagonists such as food intake, anxiety, depression, 
reward, and sleep. This will help us understand the physiological functions of 
the MCH system and suggest some of the potential applications of MCH1R 
antagonists in human disorders.
