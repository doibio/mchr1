Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonists have been studied 
as potential agents for the treatment of obesity. Initial structure-activity 
relationship studies of in-house hit compound 1a and subsequent optimization 
studies resulted in the identification of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 23, 
1-(2-acetyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-yl)-4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperidin-1-yl]butan-1-one, 
as a potent hMCHR1 antagonist. A homology model of hMCHR1 suggests that these 
compounds interact with Asn 294 and Asp 123 in the binding site of hMCHR1 to 
enhance binding affinity. Oral administration of compound 23 dose-dependently 
reduced food intake in diet-induced obesity (DIO)-F344 rats.
