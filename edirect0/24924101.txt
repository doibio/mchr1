Today, the 'obesity pandemic' is one of the biggest health issues around the 
world. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a hypothalamic neuropeptide, is one 
of the most potent, central stimulators of feeding and it also attenuates energy 
expenditure. Inhibitions of the MCH receptor, the melanin-concentrating hormone 
receptor-1 (MCHR1), has attracted considerable attention as a potential 
anti-obesity drug, during the last decade. Now, there are a large number of 
MCHR1 antagonists, pharmacological tools and clinical drug candidates that can 
provide clues to develop new structures with high potency and good 
pharmacokinetic profile. The function of MCHR1 in energy homeostasis, obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, mood disorders and inflammatory bowel disease is discussed. 
Relevant clinical trials and patent background information of the MCHR1 
antagonists over the last 4 years are also reviewed.
