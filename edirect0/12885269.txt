Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide, which centrally 
regulates food intake and stress. MCH induces food intake in rodents and, more 
generally, acts as an anabolic signal in energy regulation. In addition, MCH 
seems to be activatory on the stress axis. Two receptors for MCH in humans have 
very recently been characterised, namely, MCH-R1 and MCH-R2. MCH-R1 has received 
considerable attention, as potent and selective antagonists acting at that 
receptor display anxiolytic, antidepressant and/or anorectic properties. Feeding 
and affective disorders are both debilitating conditions that have become 
serious worldwide health threats. There are as yet no efficient and/or safe 
cures that could contain the near-pandemia phenomen of both diseases. Thus, the 
discovery of MCH-R1 antagonists may lead to the development of valuable drugs to 
treat obesity, anxiety and depressive syndromes. In addition, it opens wide 
avenues to probe additional functions of the peptide, both in the brain and in 
the peripheral nervous system.
