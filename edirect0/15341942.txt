A high-throughput screen was performed in order to identify chemotypes that are 
bound by the melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHr1). A novel 
2-amino-8-alkoxyquinoline compound (1) was identified and subsequently optimized 
using a parallel and automated procedure for the rapid production of multiple 
analogs. The structure-activity relationships that emerged from this effort are 
described, along with selected pharmacokinetic parameters of compound (d)-61 
when dosed orally in diet-induced obese mice.
