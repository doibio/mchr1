A novel series of bis-aminopyrrolidine ureas containing either a 
4-biphenylcarboxmide or 5-phenyl-2-thiophenecarboxamide group have been 
identified as potent and functional antagonists of the melanin-concentrating 
hormone receptor-1. Syntheses and SAR are described, which led to the discovery 
of compounds with high binding affinity (Ki = 1 nM) for the receptor. 
Preliminary in vitro metabolic stability data are also reported for key 
compounds.
