Compounds containing 2-arybenzimidazole ring systems linked to arylpiperidines 
were synthesized and evaluated as MCH-R1 antagonists. The results of 
structure-activity relationship studies led to the identification of compound 4c 
as a potent MCH-R1 antagonist (IC(50)=1 nM). This compound also has good 
metabolic stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic and brain penetration 
properties. However 4c was found to be potent inhibitor of the hERG potassium 
channel.
