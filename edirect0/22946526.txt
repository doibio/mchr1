MCH1R antagonists have been used to treat several diseases, such as obesity, 
depression and anxiety. In this study, we have performed several 
pharmacophore-based CoMFA studies for a series of 2,4,6 substituted quinolines 
as potent antagonists of MCH1R. Significant statistical results were obtained 
(q2 = 0.78, r2 = 0.99), indicating the high internal consistency of the 3D model 
generated, as well as its predictive power for untested compounds. The 3D model 
was externally validated employing a test set and the predicted biological 
values showed good agreement with experimental results. Important insights on 
the molecular interactions between the studied ligands and the MCH1R receptor, 
inferred from the 3D contour maps, were obtained and can be useful for the 
design of new structurally related analogs with improved binding affinity.
