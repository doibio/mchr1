Exposure to environmental cues associated with food can evoke eating behavior in 
the absence of hunger. This capacity for reward cues to promote feeding 
behaviors under sated conditions can be examined in the laboratory using 
cue-potentiated feeding (CPF). The orexigenic neuropeptide Melanin Concentrating 
Hormone (MCH) is expressed throughout brain circuitry critical for CPF. We 
examined whether deletion of the MCH receptor, MCH-1R, would in KO mice disrupt 
overeating in the presence of a Pavlovian CS+ associated with sucrose delivery. 
While both wild-type controls and KO mice showed comparable food magazine 
approach responses during the CPF test, MCH-1R deletion significantly impaired 
the ability of the CS+ to evoke overeating of sucrose under satiety. Through the 
use of a refined analysis of meal intake, it was revealed that this disruption 
to overeating behavior in KO mice reflected a reduction in the capacity for the 
CS+ to initiate and maintain bursts of licking behavior. These findings suggest 
that overeating during CPF requires intact MCH-1R signaling and may be due to an 
influence of the CS+ on the palatability of food and on regulatory mechanisms of 
peripheral control. Thus, disruptions to MCH-1R signaling may be a useful 
pharmacological tool to inhibit this form of overeating behavior.
