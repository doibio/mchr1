Optimization of a high-throughput screening hit against melanin-concentrating 
hormone receptor 1 (MCHr1) led to the discovery of 
2-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-N-[1-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethyl)-1H-indazol-6-yl]acetamide 
(7a). This compound was found to be a high-affinity ligand for MCHr1 and a 
potent inhibitor of MCH-mediated Ca(2+) release, showed good plasma and CNS 
exposure upon oral dosing in diet-induced obese mice, and is the first reported 
MCHr1 antagonist that is efficacious upon oral dosing in a chronic model of 
weight loss.
