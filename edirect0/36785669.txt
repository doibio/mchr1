PURPOSE: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most common 
histological subtype of adult kidney tumors, with a poor prognosis due to 
limited understanding of the disease mechanism. Herein, we have performed 
high-throughput bioinformatic screening to explore and identify potential 
biomarkers of DNA damage and oxidative stress for pRCC.
METHODS: RNA sequencing data related to pRCC were downloaded from the TCGA 
database, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by a wide 
variety of clustering and classification algorithms, including self-organized 
maps (SOM), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), 
fuzzy logic, and hyphenated techniques such as neuro-fuzzy networks. Then DAVID 
and STRING online biological information tools were used to analyze functional 
enrichment of the regulatory networks of DEG and construct a protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network, and then the Cytoscape software was used to identify 
hub genes. The importance of key genes was assessed by the analysis of the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the R software. Lastly, we have analyzed the 
expression of hub genes of DNA damage and oxidative stress (BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, 
and SAA1) in pRCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, as well as the 
relationship between the expression of hub genes in pRCC tissues and 
pathological characteristics and prognosis of pRCC patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1,992 DEGs for pRCC were identified, with 1,142 upregulated 
ones and 850 downregulated ones. The DEGs were significantly enriched in 
activities including DNA damage and oxidative stress, chemical synaptic 
transmission, an integral component of the membrane, calcium ion binding, and 
neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. cytoHubba in the Cytoscape software was 
used to determine the top 10 hub genes in the PPI network as BDKRB2, NMUR2, NMU, 
BDKRB1, LPAR5, KNG1, LPAR3, SAA1, MCHR1, PMCH, and NCAPH. Furthermore, the 
expression level of hub genes BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, and SAA1 in pRCC tissues was 
significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Meanwhile, the 
expression level of hub genes BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, and SAA1 in pRCC tissues was 
significantly positively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and 
the histopathology grade of pRCC. In addition, high expression levels of hub 
genes BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, and SAA1 were associated with a poor prognosis for 
patients with pRCC. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the 
expression of hub genes BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, and SAA1 were independent risk 
factors for the prognosis of patients with pRCC.
CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis suggested that BDKRB1, NMUR2, PMCH, and 
SAA1 might be potential prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for 
pRCC.
