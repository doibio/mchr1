Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by the accumulation of excess adipose 
tissue associated with an increased risk of multiple morbidities and mortality. 
At the present time, only three drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity. Agonists and antagonists of 
some of the substances implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis 
represent opportunities for anti-obesity drug development. The most promising 
targets are alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) receptors, 
cannabinoid receptors, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) receptors. MCH receptors could be major 
potential targets for the treatment of obesity. Many pharmaceutical companies 
have described MCH-R1 antagonists that have appeared over the past year. 
Recently, two compounds went into phase I clinical trials that evaluate MCH 
receptor antagonists as a new perspective for the pharmacologic treatment of 
obesity. In this review, structure-activity relationships (SAR) in the 
development of MCH-R1 antagonists are provided.
