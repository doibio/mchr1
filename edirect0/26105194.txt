Although overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions, options to 
treat them are still very limited. As part of our search for safe and effective 
MCH-R1 antagonists for the treatment of obesity, two series of pyridones and 
pyridazinones were evaluated. Optimization was aimed at improving DMPK 
properties by increasing metabolic stability and improving the safety profile by 
reducing inhibition of the hERG channel and reducing the potential to induce 
phospholipidosis. Steric shielding of a labile keto moiety with an ortho-methyl 
group and fine-tuning of the polarity in several parts of the molecule resulted 
in BI 186908 (11 g), a potent and selective MCH-R1 antagonist with favorable 
DMPK and CMC properties. Chronic administration of BI 186908 resulted in 
significant body weight reduction comparable to sibutramine in a 4 week 
diet-induced obesity model in rats. Based on its favorable safety profile, BI 
186908 was advanced to pre-clinical development.
