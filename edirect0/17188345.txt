Given into the brain, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) increases alcohol 
consumption, but the mechanism and physiological relevance of this effect are 
unclear. We hypothesized that endogenous MCH will enhance alcohol drinking and 
that MCH increases alcohol's reinforcing properties. An MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) 
antagonist, or saline was administered centrally alone, or preceding MCH or 
saline to rats trained to drink 10% alcohol using sucrose fading. Blocking MCHR1 
neither reduced alcohol intake (saline=0.4+/-0.1 g, 30 microg MCHR1 
antagonist=0.4+/-0.1 g/kg alcohol), nor attenuated MCH-induced alcohol drinking 
(MCHR1 antagonist/saline=0.7+/-0.1 g/kg, MCHR1 antagonist/MCH=0.9+/-0.1 g/kg 
alcohol). Another cohort of rats was trained to lever press for alcohol on a 
progressive ratio schedule. MCH or saline was administered centrally and lever 
presses were measured. MCH had no effect prior to the break point, but increased 
total responding during the session (saline=87.2+/-32.0, MCH=315.4+/-61.0 
presses). In conclusion, these data suggest that MCH augments alcohol drinking 
partly by enhancing the drug's reinforcing value. Further, endogenous MCH does 
not seem to regulate alcohol drinking, however because the antagonist failed to 
attenuate MCH-induced alcohol intake this conclusion is tentative.
