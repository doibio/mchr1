Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer new 
possibilities for biomedical research and clinical applications. Neurons 
differentiated from hiPSCs may be promising tools to develop novel treatment 
methods for various neurological diseases. However, the detailed process 
underlying functional maturation of hiPSC-derived neurons remains poorly 
understood. Here, we analyze the developmental architecture of hiPSC-derived 
cortical neurons, iCell GlutaNeurons, focusing on the primary cilium, a single 
sensory organelle that protrudes from the surface of most growth-arrested 
vertebrate cells. To characterize the neuronal cilia, cells were cultured for 
various periods and evaluated immunohistochemically by co-staining with 
antibodies against ciliary markers Arl13b and MAP2. Primary cilia were detected 
in neurons within days, and their prevalence and length increased with 
increasing days in culture. Treatment with the mood stabilizer lithium led to 
primary cilia length elongation, while treatment with the orexigenic 
neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone caused cilia length shortening in 
iCell GlutaNeurons. The present findings suggest that iCell GlutaNeurons develop 
neuronal primary cilia together with the signaling machinery for regulation of 
cilia length. Our approach to the primary cilium as a cellular antenna can be 
useful for both assessment of neuronal maturation and validation of 
pharmaceutical agents in hiPSC-derived neurons.
