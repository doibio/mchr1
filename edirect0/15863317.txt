A series of 4-(dimethylamino)quinazoline based antagonists of the 
melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) is described. This series was 
derived from a lead compound, AR129330, identified by HTS of a GPCR-directed 
library using a functional assay with a constitutively activated (CART) form of 
the receptor. The preliminary optimization resulted in the identification of 
compounds 20, 21, and 23.
