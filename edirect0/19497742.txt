MCH1R inhibitors with the quinoline moiety having the aromatic amine and 
aliphatic amine chain were selected, and then the effect of substituents of the 
quinoline ring on the ionic interaction were studied by calculating pK(a) values 
for these amines at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level in the gas 
phase and in water. For substituent with C, N, O, and S atoms next to the 
quinoline ring, respectively, the pK(a) values of aromatic amines are estimated 
to be 8.98, 12.19, 4.64, and 4.33 and those of the aliphatic amines are 12.65, 
10.82, 9.94, and 11.55, respectively.
