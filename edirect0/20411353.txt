Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide which has 
been shown to regulate energy homeostasis. Using genetic knockout mice lacking 
the MCH1 receptor (MCH1R), we investigated how these mice adapt to metabolic 
changes caused by excessive caloric consumption. We show that the MCH system is 
one of the players mediating behavioral and metabolic responses upon increased 
caloric consumption. MCH1R knockout mice showed decreased tendency of food 
intake upon exposure to a high-fat diet. They also are resistant to gain weight 
upon high-fat diet by increasing fat metabolism. Therefore, the MCH system is 
important in regulating metabolic responses upon various environmental stimuli 
such as high-fat diet.
