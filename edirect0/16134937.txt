Novel 6-acylamino-2-aminoquinoline melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor 
(MCH1R) antagonists were identified by sequential in silico screening with 3D 
pharmacophore models derived from a series of benzamide antagonists. The 
structure-activity relationship exploration by synthesis of analogues found 
structural demands around the western part of the compounds to be quite 
specific, whereas much structural freedom was found in the eastern part. While 
these compounds in general suffered from poor solubility properties, the 
4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxyacetamide western appendage provided a favorable 
combination of activity and solubility properties. The amine in the eastern 
appendage, originally required by the pharmacophore model and believed to 
interact with Asp123 in transmembrane 3 of MCH1R, could be removed without 
diminishing affinity or functional activity of the compounds. Docking studies 
suggested that the Asp123 interacts preferentially with the nitrogen of the 
central quinoline. Synthesis and testing of specific analogues supported our 
revised binding mode hypothesis.
