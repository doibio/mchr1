A series of 1,3-disubstituted-1H-pyrrole-based antagonists of the human 
Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Receptor 1 (h-MCH-R1) are reported. 
High-throughput screening of the AstraZeneca compound collection yielded 1, a 
hit with moderate affinity towards MCH-R1. Subsequent structural manipulations 
and SAR analysis served to rationalize potency requirements, and 12 was 
identified as a novel, functional MCH-R1 antagonist with favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties.
