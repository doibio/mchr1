Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which is an orexigenic peptide, was 
isolated and identified as the endogenous ligand of the SLC-1 receptor. We 
established a CHO cell line expressing the rat SLC-1 receptor to search for its 
endogenous ligand. The extract of rat whole brain showed inhibition of 
intracellular forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in rat SLC-1-expressing CHO 
cells and was purified. Using HPLC purification, we isolated and identified MCH 
as the endogenous ligand of the SLC-1 receptor. The authentic MCH demonstrated a 
dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cAMP accumulation in forskolin-stimulated 
rat and human SLC-1-expressing CHO cells with an EC(50) value of 0.2 nM for both 
the rat and human SLC-1 receptors. This is the first description of the 
functional receptor for MCH.
