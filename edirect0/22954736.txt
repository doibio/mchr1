Obesity is a global epidemic associated with multiple severe diseases. Several 
pharmacotherapies have been investigated including the melanin concentrating 
hormone (MCH) and its receptor 1. The development of MCHR1 antagonists are 
described with a specific perspective on different chemotypes investigated in 
efforts to overcome hERG liabilities while having orally active, potent and 
selective compounds with sufficient brain penetration. A chemometric comparison 
of ∼2000 diverse MCHR1 and ∼1000 diverse hERG ligands underline the structural 
similarities. A binding pocket analysis of a MCHR1 model and recent X-ray 
structures of GPCRs invoked in selectivity issues indicate a way to support 
future drug design.
