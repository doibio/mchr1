There are over 420 human solute carrier (SLC) transporters from 65 families that 
are expressed ubiquitously in the body. The SLCs mediate the movement of ions, 
drugs, and metabolites across membranes and their dysfunction has been 
associated with a variety of diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and central 
nervous system (CNS) disorders. Thus, SLCs are emerging as important targets for 
therapeutic intervention. Recent technological advances in experimental and 
computational biology allow better characterization of SLC pharmacology. Here we 
describe recent approaches to modulate SLC transporter function, with an 
emphasis on the use of computational approaches and computer-aided drug design 
(CADD) to study nutrient transporters. Finally, we discuss future perspectives 
in the rational design of SLC drugs.
