BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic 
neuropeptide expressed in the lateral hypothalamus that is involved in feeding 
and body weight regulation. Intracerebroventricular infusion of a peptidic MCH1 
receptor antagonist ameliorated obesity in murine models. Recently, small 
molecule MCH1 receptor antagonists have been developed and characterized for the 
treatment of obesity. However, little is known of the mechanism of the 
anti-obesity effects of MCH1 receptor antagonists.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To examine the mechanisms of action of the anti-obesity 
effect of MCH1 receptor antagonists more precisely, we conducted a pair-feeding 
study in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), chronically treated with an 
orally active and highly selective MCH1 receptor antagonist and examined changes 
in mRNA expression levels in liver, brown and white adipose tissues. We also 
assessed the acute effects of the MCH1 receptor antagonist in energy expenditure 
under thermoneutral conditions.
KEY RESULTS: Treatment with the MCH1 receptor antagonist at 30 mg.kg(-1) for 1 
month moderately suppressed feeding and significantly reduced body weight by 
24%. In contrast, pair-feeding resulted in a smaller weight reduction of 10%. 
Treatment with the MCH1 receptor antagonist resulted in a higher body 
temperature compared with the pair-fed group. TaqMan and calorimetry data 
suggested that the MCH1 receptor antagonist also stimulated thermogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that an MCH1 receptor 
antagonist caused anti-obesity effects im mice by acting on both energy intake 
and energy expenditure.
