A novel series of melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHr1) antagonists 
were the starting point for a drug discovery program that culminated in the 
discovery of 103 (AZD1979). The lead optimization program was conducted with a 
focus on reducing lipophilicity and understanding the physicochemical properties 
governing CNS exposure and undesired off-target pharmacology such as hERG 
interactions. An integrated approach was taken where the key assay was ex vivo 
receptor occupancy in mice. The candidate compound 103 displayed appropriate 
lipophilicity for a CNS indication and showed excellent permeability with no 
efflux. Preclinical GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were without 
major findings and 103 was taken into clinical trials.
