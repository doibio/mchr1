A ligand-based approach to identify potential starting points for a dual MCH-1R 
antagonist/DPPIV inhibitor medicinal chemistry program was undertaken. Potential 
ligand pairs were identified by analysis of MCH-1R and DPPIV in vitro data. A 
highly targeted synthetic effort lead to the discovery of pyridone 11, a dual 
MCH-1R antagonist/DPPIV inhibitor with selectivity over DPP8 and DPP9.
