Orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) as orexigenic neuropeptides are 
present in the lateral hypothalamus, and their receptors are distributed in the 
cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the present study, the regulatory effects of 
orexin-A, orexin-B and MCH on neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expressions were examined in primary cortical neuron 
cultures using quantitative real-time PCR. Both orexin-A and orexin-B on 6-day 
exposure significantly increased the NT-3 mRNA at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 
and 1microM. Orexin-A and B at 1microM led to an increase of twofold or more 
over the control. However, no such NT-s mRNA increase occurred with exposure to 
MCH at the same concentrations as orexins. The mRNA expression of BDNF was 
significantly increased only by orexin-B at 1microM. These findings suggest that 
orexins, but not MCH, may be an inducer of NT-3 in the cerebral cortex.
