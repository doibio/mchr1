BACKGROUND: The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), which is 
highly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus, plays a key role in energy 
homeostasis, obesity and other endocrine diseases. Hence, there is a major 
interest in in vivo imaging of this receptor. A PET tracer would allow 
non-invasive in vivo visualization and quantification of the MCHR1. The aim of 
the study was the ex vivo evaluation of the MCHR1 ligand [(18)F]FE@SNAP as a 
potential PET tracer for the MCHR1.
METHODS: [(18)F]FE@SNAP was injected directly into the jugular vein of awake 
naïve rats for ex vivo brain autoradiography, biodistribution and additional 
blood metabolite analysis. Blocking experiments were conducted using the 
unlabeled MCHR1 ligand SNAP-7941.
RESULTS: A high uptake of [(18)F]FE@SNAP was observed in the lateral 
hypothalamus and the ventricular system. Both regions were significantly blocked 
by SNAP-7941. Biodistribution evinced the highest uptake in the kidneys, 
adrenals, lung and duodenum. Specific blocking with SNAP-7941 led to a 
significant tracer reduction in the heart and adrenals. In plasma samples, 
47.73 ± 6.1 % of a hydrophilic radioactive metabolite was found 45 min after 
tracer injection.
CONCLUSIONS: Since [(18)F]FE@SNAP uptake was significantly blocked in the 
lateral hypothalamus, there is strong evidence that [(18)F]FE@SNAP is a highly 
suitable agent for specific MCHR1 imaging in the central nervous system. 
Additionally, this finding is supported by the specific blocking in the 
ventricular system, where the MCHR1 is expressed in the ependymal cells. These 
findings suggest that [(18)F]FE@SNAP could serve as a useful imaging and therapy 
monitoring tool for MCHR1-related pathologies.
