Primary cilia are ubiquitous cellular appendages that provide important yet not 
well understood sensory and signaling functions. Ciliary dysfunction underlies 
numerous human genetic disorders. However, the precise defects in cilia function 
and the basis of disease pathophysiology remain unclear. Here, we report that 
the proteins disrupted in the human ciliary disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) 
are required for the localization of G protein-coupled receptors to primary 
cilia on central neurons. We demonstrate a lack of ciliary localization of 
somatostatin receptor type 3 (Sstr3) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 
1 (Mchr1) in neurons from mice lacking the Bbs2 or Bbs4 gene. Because Mchr1 is 
involved in the regulation of feeding behavior and BBS is associated with 
hyperphagia-induced obesity, our results suggest that altered signaling caused 
by mislocalization of ciliary signaling proteins underlies the BBS phenotypes. 
Our results also provide a potential molecular mechanism to link cilia defects 
with obesity.
