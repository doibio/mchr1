The MCH receptor has been revealed as a target of great interest in positron 
emission tomography imaging. The receptor's eponymous substrate 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide hormone, which is 
located predominantly in the hypothalamus with a major influence on energy and 
weight regulation as well as water balance and memory. Therefore, it is thought 
to play an important role in the pathophysiology of adiposity, which is nowadays 
a big issue worldwide. Based on the selective and high-affinity MCH receptor 1 
antagonist SNAP-7941, a series of novel SNAP derivatives has been developed to 
provide different precursors and reference compounds for the radiosyntheses of 
the novel PET radiotracers [(11)C]SNAP-7941 and [(18)F]FE@SNAP. Positron 
emission tomography promotes a better understanding of physiologic parameters on 
a molecular level, thus giving a deeper insight into MCHR1 related processes as 
adiposity.
