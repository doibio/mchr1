Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor antagonists containing thieno- and a 
benzopyridazinone cores were designed and tested as potential anorectic agents. 
These ligands showed high affinity for the receptor, potent functional activity 
in vitro, and good oral bioavailabilty in rats. The thiophene analogue exhibited 
low iv clearance, long half-life, and high brain penetration. In obese rats, the 
thienopyridazinone demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in feeding and body 
weight with doses between 1 and 10 mg kg-1.
