Using the yeast-two-hybrid system a novel protein was identified from human 
brain that interacts with the C-terminus of melanin-concentrating hormone 
receptor 1 (MCH-R1). This protein, characterized by a Myeloid translocation 
protein 8, Nervy, DEAF1 proteins (MYND) zinc-finger domain, is termed 
MCH-R1-interacting zinc-finger protein, MIZIP. It is fully conserved in man, 
rat, mouse and highly conserved in Xenopus and zebrafish, but not detectable in 
invertebrates. MIZIP gene organization in human (six exons on chromosome 9q34.3) 
and mouse is highly conserved, yet in rodents an additional exon is generated 
giving rise to alternatively spliced mRNAs. MIZIP is expressed in brain, testis 
and stomach, where expression of MCH and MCH-R1 was previously reported. MIZIP 
interaction with MCH-R1 was verified by overlay and pull-down assays as well as 
by co-transfection experiments in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. MIZIP is 
cytoplasmically localized but gets recruited to the plasma membrane when cells 
are co-transfected with MCH-R1 supporting the notion that MIZIP is involved in 
the function of MCH-R1.
