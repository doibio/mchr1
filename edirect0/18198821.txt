Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) is a G-protein-coupled 
receptor (GPCR) and a target for the development of therapeutics for obesity. 
The structure-based development of MCH-R1 and other GPCR antagonists is hampered 
by the lack of an available experimentally determined atomic structure. A 
ligand-steered homology modeling approach has been developed (where information 
about existing ligands is used explicitly to shape and optimize the binding 
site) followed by docking-based virtual screening. Top scoring compounds 
identified virtually were tested experimentally in an MCH-R1 competitive binding 
assay, and six novel chemotypes as low micromolar affinity antagonist "hits" 
were identified. This success rate is more than a 10-fold improvement over 
random high-throughput screening, which supports our ligand-steered method. 
Clearly, the ligand-steered homology modeling method reduces the uncertainty of 
structure modeling for difficult targets like GPCRs.
