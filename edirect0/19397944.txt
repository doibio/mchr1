Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important neuropeptide hormone 
involved in multiple physiological processes. Peptide derivatives of MCH have 
been developed as tools to aid research including potent radioligands, receptor 
selective agonists, and potent antagonists. These tools have been used to 
further understand the role of MCH in physiology, primarily in rodents. However, 
the tools could also help elucidate the role for MCHR1 and MCHR2 in mediating 
MCH signaling in higher species.
