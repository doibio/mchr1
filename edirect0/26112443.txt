Despite recent approvals of anti-obesity drugs there is still a high therapeutic 
need for alternative options with higher efficacy in humans. As part of our 
MCH-R1 antagonist program for the treatment of obesity, a series of 
biphenylacetamide HTS hits was evaluated. Several issues of the initial lead 
structures had to be resolved, such as potency, selectivity over related GPCRs 
and P-gp efflux limiting brain exposure in this series. We could demonstrate 
that all parameters can be significantly improved by structural modifications 
resulting in BI 414 as a potent and orally available MCH-R1 antagonist tool 
compound with acceptable in vivo efficacy in an animal model of obesity.
