Despite the high number of drug-discovery programs dedicated to finding 
small-molecule MCH-R1 antagonists for the treatment of obesity and/or mood 
disorders, a very limited number of these have progressed into the clinic. 
Beyond the common challenges in drug design related to ADME and safety profiles, 
cardiovascular risk involving hERG binding and the potential for subsequent 
drug-induced QTc prolongation has been a major hurdle for a significant number 
of MCH-R1 research programs. Many of these programs have evolved, and 
effectively designed MCH antagonists having decreased hERG-binding affinity have 
emerged. Currently, however, only a selected few candidates have progressed to 
clinical development. Drug-design strategies, in vivo efficacy, ADME, and 
cardiovascular safety profiles for a selection of MCH-R1 antagonist research 
programs are discussed ahead.
