Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a potent orexigenic neuropeptide and a 
physiological antagonist of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in 
the brain as well as at peripheral sites, including the pigmentary systems of 
specific vertebrates. Two receptor subtypes for MCH, MCH-R1 and MCH-R2, have 
been cloned, but other receptor subtypes are likely to exist. Based on our own 
data and the current literature, we have compared the expression of different 
receptors for MCH in various mammalian cell lines and tissues. Summarizing all 
data currently available, we conclude that the two cloned MCH receptors, MCH-R1 
and MCH-R2, exhibit differences in their expression pattern, although MCH-R1 is 
generally colocalized in all tissues where MCH-R2 expression is found. It 
appears that MCH-R1 is more abundant and has a wider distribution pattern than 
MCH-R2. Other hypothetical MCH-R subtypes may be expressed in specific tissues, 
e.g., in the pigment cell system.
