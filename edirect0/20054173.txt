OBJECTIVE: In previous studies of associations of variants in the genes UCP2, 
UCP3, PPARG2, CART, GRL, MC4R, MKKS, SHP, GHRL, and MCHR1 with obesity, we have 
used a case-control approach with cases defined by a threshold for BMI. In the 
present study, we assess the association of seven abdominal, peripheral, and 
overall obesity phenotypes, which were analyzed quantitatively, and thirteen 
candidate gene polymorphisms in these ten genes in the same cohort.
METHODS: Obese Caucasian men (n = 234, BMI >or= 31.0 kg/m(2)) and a randomly 
sampled non-obese group (n = 323), originally identified at the draft board 
examinations, were re-examined at median ages of 47.0 or 49.0 years by 
anthropometry and DEXA scanning. Obesity phenotypes included BMI, fat body mass 
index, waist circumference, waist for given BMI, intra-abdominal adipose tissue, 
hip circumference and lower body fat mass (%). Using logistic regression models, 
we estimated the odds for defined genotypes (dominant or recessive genetic 
transmission) in relation to z-scores of the phenotypes.
RESULTS: The minor (rare) allele for SHP 512G>C (rs6659176) was associated with 
increased hip circumference. The minor allele for UCP2 Ins45bp was associated 
with increased BMI, increased abdominal obesity, and increased hip 
circumference. The minor allele for UCP2 -866G>A (rs6593669) was associated with 
borderline increased fat body mass index. The minor allele for MCHR1 100213G>A 
(rs133072) was associated with reduced abdominal obesity. None of the other 
genotype-phenotype combinations showed appreciable associations.
CONCLUSION: If replicated in independent studies with focus on the specific 
phenotypes, our explorative studies suggest significant associations between 
some candidate gene polymorphisms and distinct obesity phenotypes, predicting 
beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on compartments for body fat 
accumulation.
