We have identified a novel series of potent MCH-R1 antagonists based on 
l-arginine. As predicted by computational methods, there was an activity 
dependence on the pi-electronic character of the aromatic systems corresponding 
to the amino-terminus of these molecules. These results have enhanced our 
understanding of the MCH-R1 receptor and the potential for a predictive homology 
model.
