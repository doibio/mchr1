There is compelling genetic and pharmacologic evidence to indicate that 
melanin-concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHR1) signaling is involved in the 
regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The medical need for novel 
therapies to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders has led to a great 
deal of interest by pharmaceutical companies in the discovery of MCHR1 
antagonists. Recent publications describing preclinical studies have 
demonstrated that small-molecule MCHR1 antagonists decrease food intake, 
bodyweight, and adiposity in rodent models of obesity. Results from ongoing 
early-stage clinical trials with MCHR1 antagonists are eagerly awaited, as is 
the movement of other MCHR1 antagonists into the clinic.
