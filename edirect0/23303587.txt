The corticotrophin-releasing hormone-proopiomelanocortin (CRH-POMC) system in 
the skin coordinates pigmentation and the immune response. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the regulatory role of the neuroendocrine system in the 
pathogenesis of psoriasis. Using quantitative real-time-PCR, mRNA expression 
levels of 15 genes related to the CRH-POMC system were measured in punch 
biopsies from lesional and non-lesional skin of patients with psoriasis and from 
skin of healthy control subjects. Statistically significant up-regulation of 
POMC, CRH receptor type 1, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR1) and 
melanocortin receptors 2, 3 and 4 mRNA expression in lesional and in 
non-lesional skin compared with healthy control samples were established. 
Tyrosinase (TYR), T(Y)RP-1 and ASIP genes were statistically significantly 
down-regulated in lesional and non-lesional skin of psoriasis samples compared 
with healthy subjects. The up-regulation of POMC, melanocortin receptors, CRH 
receptor type 1 and MCHR1 in the lesional and non-lesional skin of psoriasis 
patients supports the importance of the local CRH-POMC system in the 
pathogenesis of psoriasis.
