Melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonists have potential for 
the treatment of obesity and several CNS disorders. In the preceding article, we 
have described a novel series of quinazolines as MCHR1 antagonists and 
demonstrated in vivo proof of principle with an early lead. Herein we describe 
the detailed SAR and SPR studies to identify an optimized lead candidate having 
good efficacy in a sub-chronic DIO model with a good cardiovascular safety 
window.
