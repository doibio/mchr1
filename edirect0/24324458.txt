The cyclic peptide Melanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) is known to control a 
large number of brain functions in mammals such as food intake and metabolism, 
stress response, anxiety, sleep/wake cycle, memory, and reward. Based on 
neuro-anatomical and electrophysiological studies these functions were 
attributed to neuronal circuits expressing MCHR1, the single MCH receptor in 
rodents. In complement to our recently published work (1) we provided here new 
data regarding the action of MCH on ependymocytes in the mouse brain. First, we 
establish that MCHR1 mRNA is expressed in the ependymal cells of the third 
ventricle epithelium. Second, we demonstrated a tonic control of MCH-expressing 
neurons on ependymal cilia beat frequency using in vitro optogenics. Finally, we 
performed in vivo measurements of CSF flow using fluorescent micro-beads in 
wild-type and MCHR1-knockout mice. Collectively, our results demonstrated that 
MCH-expressing neurons modulate ciliary beating of ependymal cells at the third 
ventricle and could contribute to maintain cerebro-spinal fluid homeostasis.
