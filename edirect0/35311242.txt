Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), an orexigenic neuropeptide, is primarily 
secreted by the hypothalamus and acts on its receptor, the melanin-concentrating 
hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), to regulate appetite and energy homeostasis. The 
Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 (MRAP2), a small single transmembrane 
protein broadly expressed in multiple tissues, has been defined as a vital 
endocrine modulator of five melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) and several other 
GPCRs in the regulation of central neuronal activities and peripheral energy 
balance. Here, we demonstrated the interaction between MRAP2 and MCHR1 by 
immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescent assay and found that MRAP2 could 
inhibit MCHR1 signaling in vitro. A series of functional truncations of 
different regions further identified that the C-terminal domains of MRAP2 
protein were required for the pharmacological modulation of intracellular Ca2+ 
coupled cascades and membrane transport. These findings elucidated the broad 
regulatory profile of MRAP2 protein in the central nervous system and may 
provide implications for the modulation of central MCHR1 function in vivo.
