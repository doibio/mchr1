Acupuncture has shown the therapeutic effect on various neurodegenerative 
disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). While investigating the 
neuroprotective mechanism of acupuncture, we firstly found the novel function of 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) as a potent neuroprotective candidate. Here, 
we explored whether hypothalamic MCH mediates the neuroprotective action of 
acupuncture. In addition, we aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of 
MCH and elucidating underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo PD models. First, 
we tested whether hypothalamic MCH mediates the neuroprotective effects of 
acupuncture by challenging MCH-R1 antagonist (i.p.) in mice PD model. We also 
investigated whether MCH has a beneficial role in dopaminergic neuronal 
protection in vitro primary midbrain and human neuronal cultures and in vivo 
MPTP-induced, Pitx3-/-, and A53T mutant mice PD models. Transcriptomics followed 
by quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were performed to reveal the 
neuroprotective mechanism of MCH. We first found that hypothalamic MCH 
biosynthesis was directly activated by acupuncture treatment and that 
administration of an MCH-R1 antagonist reverses the neuroprotective effects of 
acupuncture. A novel finding is that MCH showed a beneficial role in 
dopaminergic neuron protection via downstream pathways related to neuronal 
survival. This is the first study to suggest the novel neuroprotective action of 
MCH as well as the involvement of hypothalamic MCH in the acupuncture effects in 
PD, which holds great promise for the application of MCH in the therapy of 
neurodegenerative diseases.
