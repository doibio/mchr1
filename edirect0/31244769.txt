[11C]SNAP-7941 and its radiofluorinated, fluoro-ethyl derivative [18F]FE@SNAP 
have been developed as the first positron emission tomography tracers for 
melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) imaging. Accumulation of these 
MCHR1 PET-tracers in rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) in vivo provided first 
indication of MCHR1 expression in rodent BAT. To rule out off-target binding, 
affinity of both MCHR1 ligands toward adrenergic beta-3 receptors (ADRB3) was 
examined. Further, specific binding of [11C]SNAP-7941 to brown adipocytes and 
effects of MCHR1 ligands on brown adipocyte activation were investigated. 
SNAP-7941 and FE@SNAP evinced to be highly selective toward MCHR1. 
[11C]SNAP-7941 binding to brown adipocytes was shown to be mainly 
MCHR1-specific. This data strongly indicates MCHR1 expression in rodent BAT and 
moreover, a peripheral, anti-obesity effect of MCHR1 antagonists directly 
exerted in BAT is proposed. Moreover, MCHR1 expression in murine brown 
adipocytes was confirmed by protein and mRNA analysis. We conclude that MCHR1 
PET imaging contributes to basic research in endocrinology by elucidating the 
involvement of the MCH system in peripheral tissues, such as BAT.
