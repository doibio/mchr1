The hypothalamic peptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) plays important 
roles in energy homeostasis. Animals overexpressing MCH develop hyperphagia, 
obesity, and insulin resistance. In this study, mice lacking both the MCH 
receptor-1 (MCHr1 knockout) and leptin (ob/ob) double-null mice (MCHr1 knockout 
ob/ob) were generated to investigate whether the obesity and/or the insulin 
resistance linked to the obese phenotype of ob/ob mice was attenuated by 
ablation of the MCHr1 gene. In MCHr1 knockout ob/ob mice an oral glucose load 
resulted in a lower blood glucose response and markedly lower insulin levels 
compared with the ob/ob mice despite no differences in body weight, food intake, 
or energy expenditure. In addition, MCHr1 knockout ob/ob mice had higher 
locomotor activity and lean body mass, lower body fat mass, and altered body 
temperature regulation compared with ob/ob mice. In conclusion, MCHr1 is 
important for insulin sensitivity and/or secretion via a mechanism not dependent 
on decreased body weight.
