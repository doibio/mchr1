To aid in the identification of novel melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 
(MCHr1) antagonists, a unique virtual library of readily synthesized molecules 
was designed and assembled based on 323 monomer compounds containing reactive 
moieties in combination with 30 core molecules having diamine functionality. The 
resulting library of 3,129,870 molecules was searched using three-dimensional 
shape similarity measures that were complimented with a novel electrostatic 
distribution similarity-matching algorithm. One of the top scoring hits in this 
library was synthesized and characterized for MCHr1 antagonism, where it 
exhibited at least a threefold improvement in binding affinity and cellular 
potency relative to the parent MCHr1 ligand. This work demonstrates that the use 
of shape and electrostatic similarity matching in combination with a 
well-designed virtual library can be used to augment standard medicinal 
chemistry techniques.
