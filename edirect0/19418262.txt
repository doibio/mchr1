The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide exerting its actions 
through two G-protein-coupled receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2. MCH is implicated in 
the regulation of different physiological functions, including energy 
homeostasis and mood that is supported by the distribution of MCH and MCHR1 in 
the hypothalamus as well as corticolimbic structures. Genetic manipulation of 
MCH and MCHR1 results in a lean phenotype with increased resting energy 
expenditure as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant phenotypes. Similar 
observations have been demonstrated pharmacologically using different classes of 
selective MCHR1 antagonists. Here, we summarize the reported genetic and 
pharmacological evidence for the role played by the MCH system in the regulation 
of both energy homeostasis and mood disorders. We also comment on the utility of 
small-molecule MCHR1 antagonists for the treatment of obesity and affective 
disorders compared to existing therapies and provide a critical overview of the 
potential risks.
