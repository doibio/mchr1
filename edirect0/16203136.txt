The synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 3-amino indazole melanin 
concentrating hormone receptor-1 antagonists are reported, several of which 
demonstrated functional activity of less than 100nM. Compounds 19 and 28, two of 
the more potent compounds identified in this study, were characterized by high 
exposure in the brain and demonstrated robust efficacy when dosed in 
diet-induced obese mice.
