Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a recently discovered central nervous 
system (CNS) target for treating obesity. Two novel series of amide derivatives 
were synthesized and evaluated biologically as MCH-R1 (melanin-concentrating 
hormone receptor 1) antagonists. The results showed that diphenyl substituents 
on the amide lead to better activity than biphenyl substituents.
