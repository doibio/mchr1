BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an attractive 
target for antiobesity agents and many drug discovery programs have been 
dedicated to identify smallmolecule antagonists of melanin-concentrating hormone 
receptor 1 (MCHR1). The aim of this study was to develop a positron emission 
tomography (PET) tracer for MCHR1 for translation of preclinical pharmacology to 
clinic to enhance success rate of drug discovery programs.
METHODS: We identified 
4-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-N-[8-methyl-3-({[(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl] 
amino}ethyl)quinolin-7-yl]benzamide (Compound II) from Takeda MCHR1 antagonist 
library by utilizing binding affinity, log D value, physicochemical parameters 
ideal for a central nerve system agent, and synthetic feasibility of 
corresponding carbon-11 labeled radioligands as selection parameters for tracer 
candidates.
RESULTS: In the rat PET study, [11C] Compound II showed clear uptake in the 
caudate/putamen with the pretreatment of cyclosporine A and its uptake was 
higher than that in the cerebellum where expression of MCHR1 was reported to be 
low.
CONCLUSION: In summary, [11C]Compound II is a promising lead compound for 
developing a suitable MCHR1 PET radioligand. [11C]Compound II, in combination 
with cyclosporine A, could be used as a research tool to visualize and quantify 
MCHR1 in rodents.
