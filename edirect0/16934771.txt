BACKGROUND: Most antidepressant medications target central monoamine systems and 
are often characterized by limited efficacies and unwanted side effects. Thus, 
significant efforts are ongoing to identify novel targets for the treatment of 
depression. Growing evidence suggests that neuropeptides play a role in the 
pathophysiology of depression. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is one 
such neuropeptide, implicated in the modulation of many physiological responses.
METHODS: We utilized an array of techniques including chronic mild stress (CMS) 
as a depression paradigm, neurobehavior, gene expression analysis, and knockout 
genetics to investigate the role of MCH receptor subtype 1 (MCHR1) in murine 
models of depression.
RESULTS: We report here that following a 5-week exposure to repeated chronic 
mild stress (an ethologically relevant animal model of depression), C57Bl/6J 
mice have increased hippocampal gene expression of MCH receptor subtype 1 
(MCHR1), the cognate melanin concentrating hormone receptor in mice. This 
increased gene expression is reversed by chronic fluoxetine hydrochloride 
(Prozac) treatment. Additionally, while female and male mice carrying a null 
mutation of the MCHR1 gene show comparable anxiolytic-like behavior on the open 
field, only female knockout mice exhibit antidepressant-like behavior, when 
tested on the forced swim and tail suspension tests.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, we suggest that antagonism of the MCHR1 receptor may 
provide a novel approach for the treatment of affective disorders, including 
depression, with a potentially increased efficacy in women.
