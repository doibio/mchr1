Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide expressed in the 
lateral hypothalamus that plays an important role in energy homeostasis. To 
investigate the pharmacological consequences of inhibiting MCH signaling in 
murine obesity models, we examined the effect of acute and chronic 
administration of a selective MCH1 receptor antagonist (SCH-A) in diet-induced 
obese (DIO) and Lep(ob/ob) mice. Oral administration of SCH-A for 5 consecutive 
days (30 mg/kg q.d.) produced hypophagia, a loss of body weight and adiposity, 
and decreased plasma leptin levels in DIO mice, and hypophagia and reduced 
weight gain in Lep(ob/ob) mice. Chronic administration of SCH-A to DIO mice 
decreased food intake, body weight and adiposity, and plasma leptin and free 
fatty acids. These effects were accompanied by increases in several hypothalamic 
neuropeptides. Acute administration of SCH-A (30 mg/kg) prevented the decrease 
in energy expenditure associated with food restriction. These results indicate 
that MCH1 receptor antagonists may be effective in the treatment of obesity.
