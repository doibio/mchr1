The discovery and optimization of novel pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridin-7(6H)-one MCH-R1 
antagonists are described. A systematic SAR study probing the effects of aryl-, 
benzyl- and arylthio-substituents at the 2-position of the 
pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridin-7(6H)-ones led to identification of the 
2-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio] derivative 7b as a highly potent MCH-R1 antagonist. 
This compound also has favorable pharmacokinetic properties along with a high 
metabolic stability and a minimal impact on CYP isoforms and hERG.
