We discovered novel pyrrolidine MCHR1 antagonist 1 possessing moderate potency. 
Profiling of pyrrolidine 1 demonstrated that it was an inhibitor of the hERG 
channel. Investigation of the structure-activity relationship of this class of 
pyrrolidines allowed us to optimize the MCHR1 potency and decrease the hERG 
inhibition. Increasing the acidity of the amide proton by converting the 
benzamide in lead 1 to an anilide provided single digit nanomolar MCHR1 
antagonists while replacing the dimethoxyphenyl ring of 1 with alkyl groups 
possessing increased polarity dramatically reduced the hERG inhibition.
