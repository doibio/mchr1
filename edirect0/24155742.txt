Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that plays an 
important role in feeding behavior. It activates two G-protein-coupled 
receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2, of which MCHR1 is the primary regulator of food 
intake and energy homeostasis in rodents. In mammalian cells transfected with 
MCHR1, MCH is able to activate multiple signaling pathways including calcium 
mobilization, extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, and inhibition 
of cyclic AMP generation through Gi/o- and Gq-coupled pathways. Further evidence 
suggests that MCHR1 is regulated through posttranslational modifications, which 
control its intracellular localization and provide appropriate cellular 
responses involving G-protein signaling. This review summarizes the current data 
on the control of MCHR1 function through glycosylation and phosphorylation, as 
related to cell function. Especially, a series of mutagenesis study highlights 
the importance of complete glycosylation of MCHR1 for efficient trafficking to 
the plasma membrane.
