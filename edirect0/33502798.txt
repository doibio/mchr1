Although extensive research on brown adipose tissue (BAT) has stimulated 
optimism in the battle against obesity and diabetes, BAT physiology and organ 
crosstalk are not fully understood. Besides BAT, melanin-concentrating hormone 
(MCH) and its receptor (MCHR1) play an important role in energy homeostasis. 
Because of the link between hypothalamic MCH neurons and sympathetic BAT 
activation via β-adrenoceptors, we investigated the expression and physiological 
role of the MCHR1 in BAT. MCHR1 was detected in rodent and human BAT with 
RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. In vivo imaging in rats used the glucose 
analog [18 F]FDG and the MCHR1-tracer [11 C]SNAP-7941. We found that the 
β3-adrenoceptor (ADRB3) agonist CL316,243 increased [11 C]SNAP-7941 uptake in 
BAT. Additionally, a pharmacological concentration of SNAP-7941-a low-affinity 
ADRB3 ligand-stimulated [18 F]FDG uptake, reflecting BAT activation. In cultured 
human adipocytes, CL316,243 induced MCHR1 expression, further supporting a 
direct interaction between MCHR1 and ADRB3. These findings characterized MCHR1 
expression in rodent and human BAT for the first time, including in vitro and in 
vivo data demonstrating a link between MCHR1 and the β3-adrenergic system. The 
presence of MCHR1 in BAT emphasizes the role of BAT in energy homeostasis and 
may help uncover treatment approaches for obesity.
