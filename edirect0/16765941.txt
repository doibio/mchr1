The aim of this study was to validate melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-1 
receptor antagonism as a potential treatment of mood disorders. We attempted to 
replicate the effects previously reported with SNAP-7941 and expanded the 
investigation to three other orally bioavailable MCH-1 receptor antagonists with 
good brain penetration. SNAP-7941 (3-30 mg/kg, i.p.) and T-226296 (5-60 mg/kg, 
p.o.) (+/- racemate), were evaluated in the rat forced swim and mouse tail 
suspension tests. (+)SNAP-7941 (3-10 mg/kg, p.o.) was also tested in a modified 
5-min rat forced swim protocol as previously reported. A-665798 (3-30 mg/kg, 
p.o.) and A-777903 (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) were tested in mouse tail suspension and 
rat Vogel tests. None of the compounds showed meaningful efficacy in the 
paradigms tested. The lack of efficacy with four structurally different MCH-1 
receptor antagonists does not support a role for therapeutic treatment of 
depression/anxiety via this mechanism of action.
