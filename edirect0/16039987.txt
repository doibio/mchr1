MIZIP was originally identified as a highly conserved zinc-finger protein from 
human brain interacting with the C-terminus of the melanin-concentrating hormone 
receptor 1. However, the cellular functions of MIZIP are still not known. Here, 
we focussed on the identification of associated proteins using affinity 
purification from human cells. This resulted in the identification of alpha- and 
beta-tubulin. The interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo using GST 
pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, and was mapped to the MYND zinc-finger 
of MIZIP and to the N-terminus of tubulin. Immunoprecipitation and 
immunocytochemistry analyses demonstrate that MIZIP binds to tubulin but not to 
cellular microtubules in vivo and that ectopic expression of MIZIP does not 
interfere with the overall structure of the microtubular cytoskeleton. Our 
results suggest that MIZIP might play an important role in mammalian cells by 
associating with tubulin and thus might provide a link between MCHR1 and tubulin 
functions.
