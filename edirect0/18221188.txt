Although currently prescribed antidepressants with actions mediated through 
alteration of monoaminergic transmission have been proven to be useful for the 
treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, they are far from ideal due to 
their slow onset of action and low rate of responses. Although the brain 
monoamine systems have long been the focus of drug therapy for depression and 
anxiety disorders, current drug discovery has aimed at new molecular targets 
outside the monoamine systems to overcome these problems. Recent increase in 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of depression and anxiety has provided 
alternative molecular targets for these disorders. In particular, receptors 
within the glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and neuropeptide systems provide a 
diversity of drug targets, and molecular biological and behavioral studies of 
these receptors have revealed the important roles they play in depression and 
anxiety. Here, we review recent patents and advances in research on these 
emerging molecular targets for the treatment of depression and anxiety, and 
discuss their advantages over currently used antidepressants and anxiolytics.
