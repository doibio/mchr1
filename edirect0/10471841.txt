To identify possible ligands of the orphan somatostatin-like receptor 1 (SLC-1), 
rat brain extracts were analyzed by using the functional expression system of 
Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding SLC-1 and G protein-gated inwardly 
rectifying potassium channels (GIRK). A strong inward current was observed with 
crude rat brain extracts which upon further purification by cation exchange 
chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) yielded two 
peptides with a high agonist activity. Mass spectrometry and partial peptide 
sequencing revealed that one peptide is identical with the neuropeptide melanin 
concentrating hormone (MCH), the other represents a truncated version of MCH 
lacking the three N-terminal amino acid residues. Xenopus oocytes expressing the 
MCH receptor responded to nM concentrations of synthetic MCH not only by the 
activation of GIRK-mediated currents but also by the induction of Ca(2+) 
dependent chloride currents mediated by phospholipase C. This indicates that the 
MCH receptor can couple either to the G(i)- or G(q)-mediated signal transduction 
pathway, suggesting that MCH may serve for a number of distinct brain functions 
including food uptake behavior.
