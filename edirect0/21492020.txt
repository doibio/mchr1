INTRODUCTION: The appetite stimulating effects of melanin-concentrating hormone 
(MCH) continues to be of high interest, and there is substantial support to 
investigate the use of MCH 1-receptor antagonists for the treatment of obesity. 
Other areas of potential use for MCH 1-receptor antagonists include depression 
and anxiety. There are, to date, no clinical proof of concept data, and efforts 
are ongoing for the discovery of novel MCH 1-receptor antagonists, as evidenced 
by the number of patent applications published over the last 5 years.
AREAS COVERED: This review covers the patent literature on MCH 1-receptor 
antagonists from January 2006 to November 2010. The emphasis is on disclosed 
biological data, especially in vivo data, of exemplified compounds. Wherever 
possible, selectivity towards undesired pharmacology is analysed.
EXPERT OPINION: Over the years, different approaches have been taken to overcome 
the undesired effects of MCH 1-receptor antagonists, such as interactions with 
the hERG channel. Many programmes have faced difficulties and, to date, only a 
few compounds have progressed into humans. From this point of view, the MCH 
1-receptor is regarded as a difficult target, and whether newer programmes will 
be successful depends, to a large extent, on their selectivity.
