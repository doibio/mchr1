To develop non-basic melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) 
antagonists with a high probability of target selectivity and therapeutic 
window, we explored neutral bicyclic motifs that could replace the previously 
reported imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine or 1H-benzimidazole motif. The results indicated 
that the binding affinity of a chemically neutral 2H-indazole derivative 8a with 
MCHR1 (hMCHR1: IC50=35nM) was comparable to that of the imidazopyridine and 
benzimidazole derivatives (1 and 2, respectively) reported so far. However, 8a 
was positive in the Ames test using TA1537 in S9- condition. Based on a putative 
intercalation of 8a with DNA, we introduced a sterically-hindering cyclopropyl 
group on the indazole ring to decrease planarity, which led to the discovery of 
1-(2-cyclopropyl-3-methyl-2H-indazol-5-yl)-4-{[5-(trifluoromethyl)thiophen-3-yl]methoxy}pyridin-2(1H)-one 
8l without mutagenicity in TA1537. Compound 8l exerted significant antiobesity 
effects in diet-induced obese F344 rats and exhibited promising safety profile.
