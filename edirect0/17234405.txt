The optimization of potent MCHr1 antagonist 1 with respect to improving its in 
vitro profile by replacement of the 3,4-methylenedioxy phenyl (piperonyl) moiety 
led to the discovery of 19, a compound that showed excellent MCHr1 binding and 
functional potencies in addition to possessing superior hERG separation, CYP3A4 
profile, and receptor cross-reactivity profiles.
