Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a small cyclic peptide expressed in all 
mammals, mainly in the hypothalamus. MCH acts as a robust integrator of several 
physiological functions and has crucial roles in the regulation of sleep-wake 
rhythms, feeding behaviour and metabolism. MCH signalling has a very broad 
endocrine context and is involved in physiological functions and emotional 
states associated with metabolism, such as reproduction, anxiety, depression, 
sleep and circadian rhythms. MCH mediates its functions through two receptors 
(MCHR1 and MCHR2), of which only MCHR1 is common to all mammals. Owing to the 
wide variety of MCH downstream signalling pathways, MCHR1 agonists and 
antagonists have great potential as tools for the directed management of energy 
balance disorders and associated metabolic complications, and translational 
strategies using these compounds hold promise for the development of novel 
treatments for obesity. This Review provides an overview of the numerous roles 
of MCH in energy and glucose homeostasis, as well as in regulation of the 
mesolimbic dopaminergic circuits that encode the hedonic component of food 
intake.
