Despite remarkable progress in the elucidation of energy balance and regulation, 
the development of new anti-obesity drugs is still at the stage of infancy. 
Herein we briefly reviewed several investigational anti-obesity agents currently 
under development, consisting of agents controlling appetite, modulating 
nutrient absorption and lipid metabolism, sensing and regulating nutrient 
status, stimulating energy expenditure, and reducing adiposity. In particular, 
two promising targets such as melanocortin-4 (MC-4) receptor and melanin 
concentrating hormone (MCH)-1 receptor will be highlighted in this review 
covering major medicinal chemistry efforts and biological aspects of the 
compounds synthesized. Considering the enthusiastic efforts to develop 
efficacious and safe anti-obesity drugs, a range of novel medications treating 
obesity more effectively than is currently managed by pharmacotherapy will be 
available in near future.
