-4-Amino-2-arylbutylbenzamides such as 1 were identified as micromolar MCH 1 
receptor (MCH1R) antagonists via screening using a scintillation proximity assay 
based on [125I]-MCH binding to recombinant, human MCH1R. Subsequent lead 
optimization efforts using solid-phase parallel synthesis resulted in the 
defined structure-activity relationships and the identification of 
4-amino-2-biarylbutylureas, such as 11g, as potent single digit nanomolar MCH1R 
antagonists.
