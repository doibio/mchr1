PURPOSE: The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) has become an 
important pharmacological target, since it may be involved in various diseases, 
such as diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity. Hence, a suitable positron 
emission tomography radiotracer for the in vivo assessment of the MCHR1 
pharmacology is imperative. The current paper contrasts the extensive in vitro, 
in vivo, and ex vivo assessments of the radiotracers [18F]FE@SNAP and 
[11C]SNAP-7941 and provides comprehensive information about their biological and 
physicochemical properties. Furthermore, it examines their suitability for 
first-in-man imaging studies.
PROCEDURES: Kinetic real-time cell-binding studies with [18F]FE@SNAP and 
[11C]SNAP-7941 were conducted on adherent Chines hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells 
stably expressing the human MCHR1 and MCHR2. Small animal imaging studies on 
mice and rats were performed under displacement and baseline conditions, as well 
as after pretreatment with the P-glycoprotein/breast cancer resistant protein 
inhibitor tariquidar. After the imaging studies, detailed analyses of the ex 
vivo biodistribution were performed. Ex vivo metabolism was determined in rat 
blood and brain and analyzed at various time points using a quantitative 
radio-HPLC assay.
RESULTS: [11C]SNAP-7941 demonstrates high uptake on CHO-K1-hMCHR1 cells, whereas 
no uptake was detected for the CHO-K1-hMCHR2 cells. In contrast, [18F]FE@SNAP 
evinced binding to CHO-K1-hMCHR1 and CHO-K1-hMCHR2 cells. Imaging studies with 
[18F]FE@SNAP and [11C]SNAP-7941 showed an increased brain uptake after 
tariquidar pretreatment in mice, as well as in rats, and exhibited a significant 
difference between the time-activity curves of the baseline and blocking groups. 
Biodistribution of both tracers demonstrated a decreased uptake after 
displacement. [11C]SNAP-7941 revealed a high metabolic stability in rats, 
whereas [18F]FE@SNAP was rapidly metabolized.
CONCLUSIONS: Both radiotracers demonstrate appropriate imaging properties for 
the MCHR1. However, the pronounced metabolic stability as well as superior 
selectivity and affinity of [11C]SNAP-7941 underlines the decisive superiority 
over [18F]FE@SNAP.
