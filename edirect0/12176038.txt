In this study, we have demonstrated the presence of melanin-concentrating 
hormone (MCH) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR1) transcripts in 
human skin. Sequence analysis confirmed that the transcripts of both genes were 
identical to those previously found in human brain. In culture, endothelial 
cells showed pro-MCH expression whereas no signal was found in keratinocytes, 
melanocytes, and fibroblasts. MCHR1 expression was restricted to melanocytes and 
melanoma cells. Stimulation of cultured human melanocytes with MCH reduced the 
alpha-MSH-induced increase in cAMP production. Furthermore, the melanogenic 
actions of alpha-MSH were inhibited by MCH. We propose that the MCH/MCHR1 
signalling system is present in human skin and may have a role with the 
melanocortins in regulating the melanocyte.
