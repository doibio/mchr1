Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide. 
At least one receptor, MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1), is present in all mammals and is 
expressed widely throughout the brain, including cortex, striatum and structures 
implicated in the integration of olfactory cues such as the piriform cortex and 
olfactory bulb. Consistent with a potential role for MCH in mediating olfactory 
function, MCH knockout mice demonstrate abnormal olfactory behaviors. These 
behaviors include impaired food seeking by both genders in the context of normal 
levels of exploratory behavior, suggesting impaired olfaction. Males also 
exhibit increased aggression while females show defects in several olfactory 
mediated behaviors including mating, estrous cycle synchronization and maternal 
behavior. These findings suggest that hypothalamic inputs through MCH play an 
important role in regulating sensory integration from olfactory pathways.
