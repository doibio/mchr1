Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that acts on 
the MCH1 receptor. MCH1R is expressed widely throughout the brain, particularly 
in regions thought to be involved in the regulation of stress and emotional 
response. The role of MCH in anxiety has been controversial, however. Central 
administration of MCH has been reported to promote or reduce anxiety-like 
behaviors. The anxiolytic activity of several MCH1R antagonists has also been 
debated. To address this issue, we have tested whether TPI 1361-17, a highly 
specific and high affinity MCH1R antagonist, exerts anxiolytic effects in two 
commonly used models of anxiety, the elevated plus maze and the light-dark 
transition test. We show that this MCH1R antagonist exerts potent anxiolytic 
effects in both assays. Our study therefore supports previous studies indicating 
that MCH1R antagonists may be useful in the treatment of anxiety.
