Several studies have shown that melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an 
orexigenic peptide in rat. In the present study, a structure-activity 
relationship with MCH analogs was performed in rat, both in vitro and in vivo. 
On rat recombinant SLC-1 receptor, both cAMP inhibition and [(125)I]S36057 
binding were measured. In vivo, these analogs were injected 
intracerebroventricularly in rats and their effects were evaluated upon food 
intake. First, data obtained with the rat recombinant receptor were highly 
correlated with those obtained from its human counterpart. Second, agonist 
potencies in the cAMP assay were also highly correlated with binding affinities. 
These peptides could be classified into several groups according to their 
potency at the SLC-1 receptor (from subnanomolar activity to complete 
inactivity). Indeed, there was a strong correlation between their effects upon 
food intake and the results obtained at the rat SLC-1 receptor. The present 
report describes for the first time the rat SLC-1 receptor pharmacology and 
clearly establishes the relevance of the SLC-1 receptor in feeding behavior.
