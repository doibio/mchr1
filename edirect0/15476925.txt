The neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is expressed in central and 
peripheral tissues where it participates in the complex network regulating 
energy homeostasis as well as in other physiologically important functions. Two 
MCH receptor subtypes, MCH-R1 and MCH-R2, have been cloned which signal through 
activation of Gi/o/q proteins and hence regulate different intracellular 
signals, such as inhibition of cAMP formation, stimulation of IP3 production, 
increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and/or activation of MAP kinases. Most of 
the data were obtained with cell systems heterologously expressing either of the 
MCH receptors. Fewer reports exist on studies with cell lines which endogenously 
express MCH receptors. Here, we describe human and other mammalian cell lines 
with which MCH receptor activation can be studied under "natural" conditions and 
we summarize the characteristics and signaling pathways of the MCH receptors in 
the different cell systems.
