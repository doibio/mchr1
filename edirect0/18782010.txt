The discovery of small molecule melanin concentrating hormone receptor (MHCr1) 
antagonists as novel therapeutic agents has been widely pursued across the 
pharmaceutical industry. While multiple chemotypes of small molecule MCHr1 
antagonists have been identified and shown to induce weight loss in rodent 
models of obesity, many of these lead compounds have been found to cross react 
with the hERG channel. This review describes efforts that led to the 
identification of two sub-series of MCHr1 antagonists with low affinity for the 
hERG channel. Ultimately, however, the modifications introduced to thwart hERG 
channel activity resulted in lead compounds with sub-optimal CNS behavior.
