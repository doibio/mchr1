The evidence for an environmental component in chronic psychotic disorders is 
strong and research on the epigenetic manifestations of these environmental 
impacts has commenced in earnest. In reviewing this research, the focus is on 
three genes as models for differential methylation, MCHR1, AKT1 and TDO2, each 
of which have been investigated for genetic association with psychotic 
disorders. Environmental factors associated with psychotic disorders, and which 
interact with these model genes, are explored in depth. The location of 
transcription factor motifs relative to key methylation sites is evaluated for 
predicted gene expression results, and for other sites, evidence is presented 
for methylation directing alternative splicing. Experimental results from key 
studies show differential methylation: for MCHR1, in psychosis cases versus 
controls; for AKT1, as a pre-existing methylation pattern influencing brain 
activation following acute administration of a psychosis-eliciting environmental 
stimulus; and for TDO2, in a pattern associated with a developmental factor of 
risk for psychosis, in all cases the predicted expression impact being highly 
dependent on location. Methylation induced by smoking, a confounding variable, 
exhibits an intriguing pattern for all three genes. Finally, how differential 
methylation meshes with Darwinian principles is examined, in particular as it 
relates to the "flexible stem" theory of evolution.
