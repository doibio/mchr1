Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is essential for the discovery of 
genetic structures that related to complex quantitative traits. In this study, 
we identified 264,072 raw SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) by double 
digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), and utilized 3029 
of these SNPs to construct a genetic linkage map in orange-spotted grouper 
(Epinephelus coioides) using a regression mapping algorithm. The genetic map 
contained 24 linkage groups (LGs) spanning a total genetic distance of 1231.98 
cM. Twenty-seven significant growth-related QTLs were identified. Furthermore, 
we identified 17 genes (fez2, alg3, ece2, arvcf, sla27a4, sgk223, camk2, prrc2b, 
mchr1, sardh, pappa, syk, tert, wdrcp91, ftz-f1, mate1 and notch1) including 
three (tert, ftz-f1 and notch1) that have been reported to be involved in fish 
growth. To summarize, we mapped growth-related QTLs in the orange-spotted 
grouper. These QTLs will be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) efforts to 
improve growth-related traits in this economically important fish.
