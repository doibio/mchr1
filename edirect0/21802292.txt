A series of potent indolyl azetidine rMCHR1 antagonists were found to show poor 
CNS penetration due to Pgp efflux. We envisioned a strategy which included: 
lowering basicity; changing the conformational flexibility motif; and removal of 
a hydrogen bond donor, in an attempt to optimize this property while maintaining 
target receptor efficacy. This work resulted in mitigation of Pgp efflux, and 
led us to identify 1-dihydroindolyl azetidine derivatives with CNS penetration 
and excellent rMCHR1 binding affinity.
