Benzimidazole and indane are the two key fragments in our potent and selective 
MCH-1 receptor (MCHR1) antagonists. To identify novel linkers connecting the two 
fragments, we investigated diamino-cycloalkane-derived analogs and discovered 
highly potent antagonists with cis-1,4-diaminocyclohexane as a unique spacer in 
this chemical class. Structural overlay suggested that 
cis-1-substituted-4-aminocyclohexane functions as a bioisostere of 
4-substituted-piperidine and that the active conformation adopts a U-shaped 
orientation.
