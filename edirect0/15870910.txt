Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is known to be an important regulator for 
feeding and energy balance. MCH was recently reported to stimulate water intake 
independent of food intake. The purpose of the present study is to examine the 
dipsogenic response of MCH with special emphasis on sweetened beverages, the 
preference for which is well documented in diabetic animals. Our results showed 
that intracerebroventricular injection of MCH acutely increased food as well as 
water intake. Human (h)MCH and salmon (s)MCH increased water intake independent 
of food intake, which was not suppressed by angiotensin antagonists. hMCH and 
sMCH significantly increased both sucrose solution and food intake; on the other 
hand, agouti-related protein (AgRP) stimulated food but not sucrose intake when 
provided simultaneously. MCH-treated rats significantly increased the ingestion 
of sucrose and glucose solution, but not of saccharin, indicating that 
MCH-induced dipsogenic response is more related to caloric content than sweet 
taste per se. Significant correlation was observed between the sucrose intake 
and the mRNA expression of MCH and MCHR1 in normal rats. These results indicate 
that MCH may be an important regulator of sugar intake in normal as well as in 
obese diabetic animals.
