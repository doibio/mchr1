A series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives was identified and evaluated for 
MCH1R binding and antagonistic activity. Introduction of a methyl substituent at 
the 3-position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine provided compounds with a significant 
improvement in MCH1R affinity. Representative compounds in this series exhibited 
good potency and brain exposure in rats.
