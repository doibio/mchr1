times.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH1 receptor) 
antagonists are being considered as anti-obesity agents. The present study 
reports a new class of MCH1 receptor antagonists with an 8-methylquinoline 
scaffold. The molecular mechanism of MCH1 receptor blockade by these antagonists 
was examined.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The pharmacological properties of the 8-methylquinolines 
as exemplified by MQ1 were evaluated by use of multiple biophysical and 
cell-based functional assays.
KEY RESULTS: Multiple signalling pathways for Gαi and Gαq , and β-arrestin were 
inhibited by MQ1. Furthermore, MQ1 produced an insurmountable antagonism, 
causing a rightward shift of the curve for concentration-dependent binding of 
MCH along with a progressive reduction of the maximal response. The dissociation 
kinetics for MQ1 were determined from washout experiments as well as by affinity 
selection-MS. In short, MQ1 was shown to be a slowly dissociating reversible 
MCH1 receptor blocker with a low Koff value.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first time that a slowly dissociating 
negative allosteric modulator of the MCH1 receptor has been demonstrated to 
inhibit the numerous signalling pathways of this receptor. The characteristics 
of MQ1 are superior and distinct from previously reported MCH1 receptor 
antagonists, making members of this chemotype attractive as drug candidates.
