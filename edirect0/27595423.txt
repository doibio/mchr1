One pharmacological principle for the treatment of obesity is blockade of the 
melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHr1), which in rodents has been 
shown to be strongly associated with food intake and energy expenditure. 
However, discovery of safe and efficacious MCHr1 antagonists has proved to be 
complex. So far, six compounds have been progressed into clinical trials, but 
clinical validation of the concept is still lacking. An account of discovery of 
the three most recent clinical candidates targeting the MCHr1 receptor is given, 
with an emphasis on their physicochemical properties.
