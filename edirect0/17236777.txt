The design, synthesis, and biological studies of a novel class of MCH-R1 
antagonists based on an aminotetrahydronaphthalene ketopiperazine scaffold is 
described. Compounds within this class promoted significant body weight 
reduction in mouse diet induced obesity studies. The potential for hERG blockage 
activity and QT interval studies in anesthetized dogs are discussed.
