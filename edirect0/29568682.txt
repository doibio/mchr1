OBJECTIVES: Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) has been suggested to play a 
potential role in energy homeostasis. However, the physiological mechanism of 
BRS-3 on energy homeostasis remains unknown. Thus, we investigated the 
BRS-3-mediated neuronal pathway involved in food intake and energy expenditure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of BRS-3 in the rat brain was histologically 
examined. The BRS-3 neurons activated by refeeding-induced satiety or a BRS-3 
agonist were identified by c-Fos immunostaining. We also analyzed expression 
changes in feeding-relating peptides in the brain of fasted rats administered 
with the BRS-3 agonist.
RESULTS: In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), dorsomedial 
hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), and medial preoptic area (MPA), strong c-Fos 
induction was observed in the BRS-3 neurons especially in PVH after refeeding. 
However, the BRS-3 neurons in the PVH did not express feeding-regulating 
peptides, while the BRS-3 agonist administration induced c-Fos expression in the 
DMH and MPA, which were not refeeding-sensitive, as well as in the PVH. The 
BRS-3 agonist administration changed the Pomc and Cart mRNA level in several 
brain regions of fasted rats.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BRS-3 neurons in the PVH are a novel 
functional subdivision in the PVH that regulates feeding behavior. As the MPA 
and DMH are reportedly involved in thermoregulation and energy metabolism, the 
BRS-3 neurons in the MPA/DMH might mediate the energy expenditure control. POMC 
and CART may contribute to BRS-3 neuron-mediated energy homeostasis regulation. 
In summary, BRS-3-expressing neurons could regulate energy homeostasis through a 
novel neuronal pathway.
