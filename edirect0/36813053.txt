Melanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) with two subtypes R1 and R2. MCH-R1 is involved in the control of energy 
homeostasis, feeding behavior and body weight. Many studies have proved that 
administration of MCH-R1 antagonists significantly reduces food intake and 
causes weight loss in animal models. Herein, we report the optimization of our 
previously reported virtual screening hits into novel MCH-R1 ligands with chiral 
aliphatic nitrogen-containing scaffolds. The activity was improved from the 
micromolar range of the initial leads to 7 nM. We also disclose the first MCH-R1 
ligands based on a diazaspiro[4.5]decane nucleus with sub-micromolar activity. A 
potent MCH-R1 antagonist with acceptable pharmacokinetic profile could represent 
a new hope for the management of obesity.
