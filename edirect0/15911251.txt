A series of urea-based N-1-(2-aminoethyl)-indazoles was synthesized and 
evaluated for melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHr1) antagonism in 
both binding and functional assays. Several compounds that acted as MCHr1 
antagonists were identified, and optimization afforded a compound with excellent 
binding affinity, good functional potency, and oral efficacy in a chronic model 
for weight loss in diet-induced obese mice.
