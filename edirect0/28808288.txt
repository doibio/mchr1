The MCHR1 is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and changes of the 
expression are linked to a variety of associated diseases, such as diabetes and 
adiposity. The study aimed at the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 
[11C]SNAP-7941 and [18F]FE@SNAP as potential PET-tracers for the MCHR1. 
Competitive binding studies with non-radioactive derivatives and small-animal 
PET/CT and MRI brain studies were performed under baseline conditions and tracer 
displacement with the unlabelled MCHR1 antagonist (±)-SNAP-7941. Binding studies 
evinced high binding affinity of the non-radioactive derivatives. Small-animal 
imaging of [11C]SNAP-7941 and [18F]FE@SNAP evinced high tracer uptake in 
MCHR1-rich regions of the ventricular system. Quantitative analysis depicted a 
significant tracer reduction after displacement with (±)-SNAP-7941. Due to the 
high binding affinity of the non-labelled derivatives and the high specific 
tracer uptake of [11C]SNAP-7941 and [18F]FE@SNAP, there is strong evidence that 
both radiotracers may serve as highly suitable agents for specific MCHR1 
imaging.
