Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that plays a 
key role in energy homeostasis. Like many neuropeptides, it signals through two 
G protein-coupled receptors. MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) is the sole receptor 
expressed in rodents and couples to G(i) and G(q) proteins. Little is known 
about the intracellular pathways engaged by MCH and its receptor. Using HEK293 
cells stably expressing MCHR1, we demonstrate that MCH, acting through MCHR1, 
antagonizes the action of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator that 
increases intracellular levels of cAMP. MCH also inhibits cAMP induction by the 
G(s)-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor. Activation of either the G(i)- or 
G(s)-dependent pathway typically results in ERK phosphorylation in HEK293 cells. 
In contrast to opposing actions on cAMP synthesis, simultaneous MCH and 
forskolin treatment results in synergistic activation of ERK. This synergy 
proceeds through pertussis toxin-independent pathways and requires several 
enzymatic activities such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, phospholipase 
C, and Src kinase. Finally, we provide evidence that such positive interactions 
are not limited to cell lines but can also be observed in the brain.
