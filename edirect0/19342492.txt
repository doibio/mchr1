Drug addiction is mediated by complex neuronal processes that converge on the 
shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh). The NAcSh receives inputs from the 
lateral hypothalamus (LH), where self-stimulation can be induced. 
Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is produced mainly in the LH, and its 
receptor (MCH1R) is highly expressed in the NAcSh. We found that, in the NAcSh, 
MCH1R is coexpressed with dopamine receptors (D1R and D2R), and that MCH 
increases spike firing when both D1R and D2R are activated. Also, injecting MCH 
potentiates cocaine-induced hyperactivity in mice. Mice lacking MCH1R exhibit 
decreased cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, as well as cocaine 
sensitization. Using a specific MCH1R antagonist, we further show that acute 
blockade of the MCH system not only reduces cocaine self-administration, but 
also attenuates cue- and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Thus, the MCH system has 
an important modulatory role in cocaine reward and reinforcement by potentiating 
the dopaminergic system in the NAcSh, which may provide a new rationale for 
treating cocaine addiction.
