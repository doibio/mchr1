We have designed and synthesized two novel series of MCH-R1 antagonists based on 
a substituted biphenylmethyl urea core. SAR was explored, suggesting that 
optimal binding with the receptor was achieved when the biphenylmethyl group and 
the linker were substituted on the same nitrogen of the urea moiety. Compound 
1-(3'-cyano-4-biphenylmethyl)-3-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-1-{2-[1-(4-methylbenzyl)-4-piperidinyl]ethyl}urea 
2t showed the best antagonist binding activity to the MCH-R1 with a 43 nM K(i).
