Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) exerts a positive regulation on appetite and 
binds to the G protein-coupled receptors, MCH1R and MCH2R. In rodents, MCH is 
produced by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus with projections to various 
hypothalamic and other brain sites. In the present study, MCH1R was shown, by 
immunocytochemistry, to be present in the human infundibular nucleus/median 
eminence, paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and perifornical 
area, although in the latter two regions, only a few MCH1R-containing cells were 
found. In addition, MCH1R staining was found in nerve fibers in the 
periventricular nucleus, dorsomedial and ventromedial nucleus, suprachiasmatic 
nucleus, and tuberomammillary nucleus. A significant 1.6 times increase in the 
number of MCH1R cell body staining was found in the infundibular nucleus in 
postmortem brain material of cachectic patients, compared with matched controls, 
supporting a role for this receptor in energy homeostasis in the human.
