Over the past ten years, tremendous advances in our understanding of the role of 
the hypothalamic neurohormone, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and its 
involvement in the regulation of food intake and body weight have been achieved. 
The MCHR1 receptor has been actively targeted as a much-needed, novel treatment 
for obesity, a disease of epidemic proportion in the United States. Numerous 
companies have joined the competition to be the first to produce a small 
molecule antagonist targeting MCHR1 receptors in the race for therapeutics for 
this disease. This review details the rising need for new treatments for 
obesity; the rationale and target validation of MCHR1 receptor antagonists as 
potential treatments for this disease; and the current status of the numerous 
small molecule MCHR1 antagonists in development by different companies. MCHR1 
antagonists might find an additional usage in the treatment of anxiety and 
depression disorders. The rationale and current status of this effort by several 
companies is also reviewed.
