OBJECTIVE: To identify and functionally characterize single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-R1 and -R2.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The entire coding regions and intron/exon 
splice junction regions of MCH-R1 and MCH-R2 were sequenced from anonymous white 
(n=45) and African-American (n=46) individuals. DNA was analyzed, and SNPs were 
identified using Phred, Phrap, and Consed software. DNA constructs containing 
MCH-R1 and MCH-R2 SNPs were generated and expressed in CHO cells. The effect of 
the SNPs in MCH-R1 and MCH-R2 were assessed in receptor binding assays and 
functional assays measuring changes in intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ levels.
RESULTS: We identified 12 SNPs in the MCH-R1 gene. Two of these SNPs are in 
coding regions, and one produces an arginine-for-glycine substitution at residue 
34 in the MCH-R1 sequence. This SNP is present at a minor allele frequency of 
15% in the African-American population tested in this study. We identified eight 
SNPs in the MCH-R2 gene. Four of these SNPs are in coding regions, and two 
produce amino acid substitutions. Lysine substitutes for arginine at residue 63 
of the African-American population, and glutamine substitutes for arginine at 
residue 152 in whites (minor allele frequency of 2% for both SNPs). No changes 
in receptor binding or functional signaling were observed with the SNP mutations 
in MCH-R1 or MCH-R2.
DISCUSSION: These data indicate that potential therapeutics designed to act at 
the MCH receptor are unlikely to have altered effects in subpopulations that 
express variant forms of MCH-R1 or MCH-R2.
