Since its discovery as the first receptor for the orexigenic neuropeptide 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), the MCH receptor, MCHR1, has been actively 
pursued for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of obesity. Mice with 
targeted deletion of MCHR1 or its cognate ligand, MCH, generally have decreased 
body weight and fat mass and are resistant to diet-induced obesity compared with 
their wild-type counterparts. Mice treated via intracerebroventricular infusion 
with MCH, or that overexpress MCH or MCHR1, exhibit weight gain compared with 
control animals. MCHR1 is also a central target of leptin signaling and appears 
to be a mediator of insulin resistance. The distribution of MCH and MCHR1 in rat 
brain, outside of regions that control appetite and satiety, has led to the 
finding that MCH signaling participates in other functions such as emotion and 
stress. This review will describe in detail the biological studies that show how 
MCH and MCHR1 control numerous physiological functions. The current status of 
the development of MCHR1 antagonists for clinical use will also be assessed. 
Given the substantial link between obesity and its many associated afflictions, 
a single pharmaceutical agent that could be used to treat multiple pathologies 
would be welcome.
