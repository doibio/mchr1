Genetic manipulation studies in mice at both the MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) as well 
as the MCH peptide levels have implicated MCHR1 as a key player in energy 
homeostasis. The phenotype exhibited by these studies, that is, increased 
metabolic rate, resistance to high fat diet, and subsequent weight loss, has 
spurred considerable efforts to develop antagonists of MCHR1. In continuation of 
efforts directed toward this goal, the present work capitalizes on the putative 
binding mode of an MCH antagonist, resulting in the identification of several 
novel chemotypes that are potent and selective MCHR1 antagonists. In addition, 
the favorable pharmacokinetics of representative examples has allowed for the 
evaluation of an MCHR1 antagonist in a high fat diet-induced obese rodent model 
of obesity. The tolerability of the right-hand side of the template for diverse 
chemotypes accompanied by favorable effects on weight loss enhances the 
attractiveness of this template in the pursuit toward development of effective 
anti-obesity agents.
