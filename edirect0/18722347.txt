The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) 1 is a G protein-coupled 
receptor involved in the regulation of appetite and energy expenditure in 
mammals. Here, we show that MCHR1 partitions to lipid rafts in stably expressing 
Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition to co-fractionating with lipid rafts 
containing caveolin-1 on sucrose gradients, caveolin-1 was present in MCHR1 
immunoprecipitates, suggesting that MCHR1 complexes with caveolae. The 
cholesterol-depleting drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin impaired MCH-mediated ERK 
signaling. These data suggest that a functional interaction between MCHR1 and 
caveolin-1 in lipid rafts exists and provide a basis for further biochemical 
studies to understand the significance on MCH-mediated signal transduction 
events.
