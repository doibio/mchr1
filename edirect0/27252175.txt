Regulatory authorities have indicated that new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) should not be associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular 
risk. Human genetics may be able to guide development of antidiabetic therapies 
by predicting cardiovascular and other health endpoints. We therefore 
investigated the association of variants in six genes that encode drug targets 
for obesity or T2D with a range of metabolic traits in up to 11,806 individuals 
by targeted exome sequencing and follow-up in 39,979 individuals by targeted 
genotyping, with additional in silico follow-up in consortia. We used these data 
to first compare associations of variants in genes encoding drug targets with 
the effects of pharmacological manipulation of those targets in clinical trials. 
We then tested the association of those variants with disease outcomes, 
including coronary heart disease, to predict cardiovascular safety of these 
agents. A low-frequency missense variant (Ala316Thr; rs10305492) in the gene 
encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), the target of GLP1R agonists, 
was associated with lower fasting glucose and T2D risk, consistent with GLP1R 
agonist therapies. The minor allele was also associated with protection against 
heart disease, thus providing evidence that GLP1R agonists are not likely to be 
associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Our results 
provide an encouraging signal that these agents may be associated with benefit, 
a question currently being addressed in randomized controlled trials. Genetic 
variants associated with metabolic traits and multiple disease outcomes can be 
used to validate therapeutic targets at an early stage in the drug development 
process.
