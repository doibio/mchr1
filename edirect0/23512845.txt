OBJECTIVE: The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a centrally acting peptide 
implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and body weight, although its 
role in glucose homeostasis is uncertain. Our objective was to determine effects 
of MCHR1 antagonism on energy budgets and glucose homeostasis in mice.
METHODS: Effects of chronic oral administration of a specific MCHR1 antagonist 
(GW803430) on energy budgets and glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese (DIO) 
C57BL/6J mice were examined.
RESULTS: Oral administration of GW803430 for 30 days reduced food intake, body 
weight, and body fat. Circulating leptin and triglycerides were reduced but 
insulin and nonesterified fatty acids were unaffected. Despite weight loss there 
was no improvement in glucose homeostasis (insulin levels and intraperitoneal 
glucose tolerance tests). On day 4-6, mice receiving MCHR1 antagonist exhibited 
decreased metabolisable energy intake and increased daily energy expenditure. 
However these effects had disappeared by day 22-24. Physical activity during the 
dark phase was increased by MCHR1 antagonist treatment throughout the 30-day 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: GW803430 produced a persistent anti-obesity effect due to both a 
decrease in energy intake and an increase in energy expenditure via physical 
activity but did not improve glucose homeostasis.
