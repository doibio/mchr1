OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of high-fat (HF) diet on the body weight 
and the mRNA expression of melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) and 
leptin receptor (OB-Rb) in the adipose tissue in rats, the two important and 
opposite factors in regulating the body weight.
METHODS: Post-weaning rats were divided into 3 groups: the NC group were fed a 
normal-chow diet (NC) (13% calories from fat), the HF group with a HF-diet (47% 
calories from fat) and the PHF group pair-fed a HF-diet (47% calories from fat). 
At the end of 8th week, the gained bodyweight, the plasma melanin concentrating 
hormone (MCH) and leptin, and the expression levels of MCHR1 and OB-Rb in the 
adipose tissue were measured.
RESULTS: Both the HF-diet and pair-fed HF-diet enhanced the body weight 
(P<0.01), plasma MCH (P<0.01) and leptin concentrations (P<0.05). In the adipose 
tissue, HF-diet resulted in significant increase in MCHR1 (PHF group,P<0.05) and 
decrease in OB-Rb mRNA levels (HF group,P<0.01; PHF group,P<0.05). No 
statistical difference was found between the HF group and the PHF group in terms 
of the aforementioned data (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Chronic intake of iso-caloric HF-diet and ad libitum HF-diet 
obviously results in increase in the body weight, serum leptin, and MCH 
concentration. Diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders are possibly 
correlated with up-regulated expression of MCHR1 and down-regulated expression 
of OB-Rb in the adipose tissue.
