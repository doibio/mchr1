It is well recognized that the hypothalamus is of central importance in the 
regulation of food intake and fat mass. Recent studies indicate that it also 
plays an important role in the regulation of bone mass. Melanin concentrating 
hormone (MCH) is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and has been implicated in 
regulation of energy homeostasis. We developed MCHR1 inactivated mice to 
evaluate the physiological role of this receptor. Interestingly, the MCHR1(-/-) 
mice have osteoporosis, caused by a reduction in the cortical bone mass, while 
the amount of trabecular bone is unaffected. The reduction in cortical bone mass 
is due to decreased cortical thickness. Serum levels of c-telopeptide, a marker 
of bone resorption, are increased in MCHR1(-/-) mice, indicating that the 
MCHR1(-/-) mice have a high bone turnover osteoporosis. In conclusion, the 
MCHR1(-/-) mice have osteoporosis, indicating that MCHR1-signalling is involved 
in a tonic stimulation of bone mass.
