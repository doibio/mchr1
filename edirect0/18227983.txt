Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a neuropeptide that was originally 
isolated from salmon pituitary where it causes pigment aggregation. MCH is also 
abundantly present in mammalian neurons and expressed in the lateral 
hypothalamus and zona incerta, brain regions that are known to be at the center 
of feeding behavior. MCH binds to and activates two G protein-coupled receptors, 
MCH1R and MCH2R. Although MCH2R is non-functional in rodents, genetic and 
pharmacological studies have demonstrated that rodent MCH1R is involved in the 
regulation of feeding behavior and energy balance. Unexpectedly, some 
antagonists have provided evidence that MCH signaling participates in the 
regulation of other processes, such as emotion and stress. The discovery of MCH 
receptors has extensively promoted the progress of MCH studies and may represent 
an ideal example of how deorphanized receptors can open new directions toward 
more detailed physiological studies.
