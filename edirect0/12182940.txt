Rhesus monkey MCH-R1 and MCH-R2 receptors were cloned. Amino acid homology is 
98.8% between monkey and human MCH-R1, while monkey and human MCH-R2 are 98% 
homologous. Binding and intracellular signaling characteristics of the monkey 
receptors were compared with the human homologues. The results demonstrate that 
MCH binds to the monkey MCH-R1 receptor with a K(d) of 6.5 nM and monkey MCH-R2 
with a K(d) of 2.2 nM similar to K(d) values for human MCH-R1 and MCH-R2. 
Additionally, monkey MCH-R1 couples through G(i)/G(o) and G(q)-type G proteins 
similar to human MCH-R1 whereas monkey and human MCH-R2 utilize the G(q) 
signaling pathway.
