A series of potent 2-carboxychromone-based melanin-concentrating hormone 
receptor 1 (MCHr1) antagonists were synthesized and evaluated for hERG (human 
Ether-a-go-go Related Gene) channel affinity and functional blockade. Basic 
dialkylamine-terminated analogs were found to weakly bind the hERG channel and 
provided marked improvement in a functional patch-clamp assay versus previously 
reported antagonists of the series.
