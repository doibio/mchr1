Optimization of high-throughput screening hit 1a led to the identification of a 
novel spiro-piperidine class of melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor 
(MCH-1R) antagonists. Compound 3c was identified as a highly potent and 
selective MCH-1R antagonist, which has an IC(50) value of 0.09 nM at hMCH-1R. 
The synthesis and structure-activity relationships of the novel spiro-piperidine 
MCH-1R antagonists are described.
