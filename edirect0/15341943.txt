The continued SAR investigation of 2-amino-8-alkoxy quinolines as melanin 
concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHr1) antagonists is reported. Prior 
hit-to-lead efforts resulted in the identification of 1 as a robust MCHr1 
antagonist. Further delineation of the structural parameters essential for 
MCHr1-binding affinity of this class of nontraditional GPCR ligands resulted in 
the identification of compounds such as 33, 34 and 37, which demonstrate single 
digit nanomolar antagonism of MCHr1-mediated Ca(2+) release. The synthesis and 
biological evaluation of these compounds are reported.
