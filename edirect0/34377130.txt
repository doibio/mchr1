INTRODUCTION: Although the exact etiopathogenesis of vitiligo is unknown, the 
autoimmunity hypothesis is much in evidence. The autologous serum skin test 
(ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) are in vivo methods used in the 
diagnosis of some autoimmune diseases, which are easy and inexpensive to 
perform.
AIM: In this study, we investigated whether or not ASST and APST could determine 
autoimmunity in patients with vitiligo.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 30 vitiligo patients presenting to the 
dermatology outpatient clinic and 30 healthy volunteers without any known 
autoimmune diseases were included. Antibodies such as tyrosinase, 
tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2) and 
melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antibodies determined to be 
associated with vitiligo were examined. In addition, the association of these 
antibodies with the positivity of ASST and APST, which were suggested to be 
associated with autoimmunity, were examined.
RESULTS: In our study, tyrosinase antibody was found to be significantly higher 
in vitiligo patients. ASST was positive in 12 (40%) patients with vitiligo and 8 
(26.6%) control subjects. APST was positive in 8 (26.6%) of the patients with 
vitiligo and in 2 (6.6%) of the controls, and there was a significant difference 
between the groups in terms of APST positivity (p = 0.032). In addition, in our 
study, a significant correlation was found between TYRP1 antibody positivity and 
APST positivity in the patient group (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that we may use APST to investigate the 
autoimmune etiopathogenesis of vitiligo.
