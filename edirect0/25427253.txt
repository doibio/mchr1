We have generated a novel monoclonal antibody targeting human FGFR1c (R1c mAb) 
that caused profound body weight and body fat loss in diet-induced obese mice 
due to decreased food intake (with energy expenditure unaltered), in turn 
improving glucose control. R1c mAb also caused weight loss in leptin-deficient 
ob/ob mice, leptin receptor-mutant db/db mice, and in mice lacking either the 
melanocortin 4 receptor or the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1. In 
addition, R1c mAb did not change hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of Agrp, 
Cart, Pomc, Npy, Crh, Mch, or Orexin, suggesting that R1c mAb could cause food 
intake inhibition and body weight loss via other mechanisms in the brain. 
Interestingly, peripherally administered R1c mAb accumulated in the median 
eminence, adjacent arcuate nucleus and in the circumventricular organs where it 
activated the early response gene c-Fos. As a plausible mechanism and coinciding 
with the initiation of food intake suppression, R1c mAb induced hypothalamic 
expression levels of the cytokines Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and 3 and 
ERK1/2 and p70 S6 kinase 1 activation.
