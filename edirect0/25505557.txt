Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) regulates food intake through activation of 
the receptor, MCHR1. We have identified AMG 076 as an orally bioavailable potent 
and selective small molecule antagonist of MCHR1. In mouse models of obesity, 
AMG 076 caused a reduction in body weight gain in wild-type (MCHR1+/+) but not 
in knockout (MCHR1-/-) mice. The body weight reduction was associated with 
decreases in food intake and increases in energy expenditure. Importantly, we 
show that these MCHR1-dependent effects of AMG 076 were also reflected in 
improved metabolic phenotypes, increased glucose tolerance and insulin 
sensitivity. Preliminary data on effects of AMG 076 in obese cynomolgus monkeys 
are also presented.
