The gene encoding the mouse melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 was 
isolated and its structural organization and flanking regions were 
characterized. The 3' flanking region is marked by the presence of two 
polyadenylation signals but used with different frequencies. RNase protection 
and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) identified multiple transcription 
initiation sites between -150 and -203 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. 
Functional analysis of deletion mutants reveals a cell independent 
transcriptional activity localized between nucleotide -305 and -589. The 
proximal 1.5 kb region does not possess consensus TATA or CAAT boxes but has 
several consensus sequences for regulatory elements including USF, GATA, AP1, 
AP4, MyoD, GKLF and Ikaros that could explain the broad expression of the 
receptor.
