Obesity has reached epidemic proportions across the developed world. Even though 
there have been numerous scientific advances in terms of the understanding of 
the regulation of energy homeostasis, few novel anti-obesity drugs have emerged. 
Furthermore, those that are available have limited efficacy in producing and 
maintaining a weight loss beyond 10%. This is partly attributable to the complex 
neuronal circuitry at play within the central nervous system and periphery, 
which acts to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. This article will 
focus on a selection of the many products (peptides, neurotransmitters and 
others) such as endocannabinoids, Neuropeptide Y, Orexins, Melanin-Concentrating 
Hormone, Melanocortins, Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript and 
Serotonin, expressed within the brain, that have been shown to influence energy 
balance. The true relevance of many of these to the regulation of human energy 
balance remains uncertain, but some novel anti-obesity drugs aimed at these 
targets are likely to emerge in the next few years.
