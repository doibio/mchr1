Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a regulator of ingestive behavior, but 
several issues regarding its effects on specific components of ingestive 
behavior remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we injected, in the 3rd ventricle 
of male Wistar rats, saline, MCH (5 microg), MCH (5 mug) together with a MCH1-R 
antagonist (A, 10 microg) and the antagonist alone (A, 10 microg). Our results 
show that (1) central administration of MCH stimulates food intake (lab chow and 
medium high fat diet) and this can be blocked by a MCH1-R antagonist; (2) the 
MCH-induced increase in food intake is mediated through increased meal number, 
meal duration and meal size; (3) the MCH1-R antagonist is able to significantly 
reduce the intake of a highly palatable food (condensed sweet milk) and is more 
effective in blocking MCH-induced food intake when rats are fed a palatable 
medium high fat food; and (4) MCH stimulated water intake independently from and 
disproportionately to food intake. In conclusion, our results point to an 
involvement of endogenous MCH in the enhanced intake of palatable food. 
Furthermore, they confirm that MCH stimulates not only food intake but also 
water intake.
