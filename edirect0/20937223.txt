Appetite regulating neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) has been 
implicated in obesity. It functions through its two receptors MCHR1 and MCHR2. 
While MCH and MCHR1 have been studied more extensively, the function of MCHR2 
remains largely unknown, due to the lack of suitable in vitro and in vivo 
models. To create an in vitro system of genetic knock-down of MCHR2 in mammalian 
cells, we constructed four small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against human MCHR2 in 
eukaryotic expression vector, and transfected the plasmids into CHO cells that 
stably express human MCHR2. Using the empty vector or a negative shRNA control 
plasmid, we show that MCHR2-shRNAs suppressed 45.8% - 66.4% of MCHR2 expression 
at both mRNA and protein levels. As the result, in cells carrying the 
MCHR2-shRNAs, binding of MCHR2 to MCH was decreased by 39.4% - 78.7% accompanied 
by a similar decrease in affinity of the receptor to ligand by 40.9% - 81.9%. 
These cells still respond to MCH treatment, but intracellular Ca2+ release as 
the downstream signaling event was also decreased by 114.8% - 822.4%. Together, 
this study generated a set of shRNAs and cell lines as valuable reagents for 
further study on MCHR2 functions. These results will ultimately help to advance 
our knowledge about appetite regulating neuropeptide receptors.
