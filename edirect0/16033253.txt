Herein, we report a small molecule MCH-R1 antagonist which demonstrates oral 
efficacy in chronic rodent models. Substituted phenyl biaryl urea derivatives 
were synthesized and evaluated as MCH-R1 antagonists for the treatment of 
obesity. The structure-activity relationship studies in this series resulted in 
identification of urea 1 as a potent and selective MCH-R1 antagonist. Compound 1 
exhibited oral efficacy in chronic (28 d) rodent models at 3-30 mpk showing 
significant reduction in food intake and weight gain relative to controls.
