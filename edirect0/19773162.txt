A series of pyrimidine analogues derived from ATC0175 were potent antagonists of 
human MCH-R1 in vitro. Significantly improved receptor selectivity was achieved 
with several analogues from this series, but no improvement in brain 
partitioning was noted. One example from this series was shown to inhibit food 
intake and decrease body weight in a chronic study. However no clear correlation 
between the pharmacodynamic effect and the pharmacokinetic data with respect to 
brain concentration was discernible leading us to conclude that the observed 
effect was most likely not due to interaction with the MCH-R1.
