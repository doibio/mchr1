Our investigation of the structure-activity and structure-liability 
relationships for dihydropyrrolopyrazol-6-one MCHR1 antagonists revealed that 
off-rate characteristics, inferred from potencies in a FLIPR assay following a 2 
h incubation, can impact in vivo efficacy. The in vitro and exposure profiles of 
dihydropyrrolopyrazol-6-ones 1b and 1e were comparable to that of the 
thienopyrimidinone counterparts 41 and 43 except for a much faster MCHR1 
apparent off-rate. The greatly diminished dihydropyrrolopyrazol-6-one 
anti-obesity response may be the consequence of this rapid off-rate.
