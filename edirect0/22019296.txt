A new class of MCHR1 antagonists was discovered via a high-throughput screen. 
Optimization of the lead structure resulted in the identification of indole 10e. 
This compound possesses good pharmacokinetic properties across preclinical 
species and is efficacious in reducing food consumption in an MCH cannulated rat 
model and a cynomolgus monkey food consumption model.
