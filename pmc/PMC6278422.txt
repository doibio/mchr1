1. Introduction
The nitrogen-containing heterocycles are important building blocks for many bioactive natural products and commercially available drugs. As pharmacologically important scaffolds, they have attracted considerable attention from chemists [1]. Indazoles are one of the most important classes of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds bearing a bicyclic ring structure made up of a pyrazole ring and a benzene ring. Indazole usually contains two tautomeric forms: 1H-indazole and 2H-indazole (Figure 1). Since 1H-indazole is more thermodynamically stable than 2H-indazole, it is the predominant tautomer [2].

Indazole derivatives scarcely occur in nature, but this particular nucleus in a variety of synthetic compounds possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, antitumor, antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-HIV activities [3,4,5,6,7,8].

Diversely substituted indazole-containing compounds furnished with different functional groups represent significant pharmacological activities and serve as structural motifs in drug molecules. For example, niraparib 1 (Figure 2) has been widely used as an anticancer drug for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal, breast and prostate cancer [9]. Pazopanib 2 (Figure 2) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved by the FDA for renal cell carcinoma [10]. Bendazac 3 and Benzydamine 4 are two commercially available anti-inflammatory drugs, which contain the 1H-indazole scaffold (Figure 2) [11].

In light of indazole scaffolds exhibiting a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, numerous methods have been developed to construct of these heterocycles with better biological activities.

There are some excellent reviews, which have been published on the biological properties of this class of compounds [12,13,14]. This review serves as a comprehensive overview of recent literature that references the synthesis and biological activities of novel indazole-containing derivatives.

2. Synthesis Route for Indazole Derivatives
2.1. Synthesis of 1H-Indazole
The synthesis of 1H-indazoles 7 from aminohydrazones 6 with an intramolecular ligand-free palladium-catalyzed C-H amination reaction has been reported by Charette et al. [15]. Substituted aminohydrazones were easily prepared based on trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride-mediated activation of tertiary amides 5, and the addition of nucleophilic hydrazides (Scheme 1). Chang et al. [16] treated diaryl and tert-butyl aryl ketone hydrazones 8 with iodine in the presence of potassium iodide and sodium acetate obtaining 1H-indazoles 9 via direct aryl C-H amination, as shown in Scheme 2. The synthesis of 1H-indazoles 11 from arylhydrazones 10 through direct aryl C-H amination using [bis-(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) as an oxidant was described by Zhang et al. (Scheme 3) [17]. The reaction displayed good functional group compatibility and provided the corresponding compounds in good yields. It is worth noting that both of the two following examples underwent a metal free catalyzed process.

Tang et al. [18] developed a protocol that realized the thermo-induced isomerization of o-haloaryl N-sulfonylhydrazones and Cu2O-mediated cyclization to obtain 1H-indazoles 13 (Scheme 4). Moreover, the reaction tolerated various functional groups. Wang et al. [19] disclosed a versatile approach for the synthesis of 1H-indazoles 15 via a cyclization of o-haloaryl N-sulfonylhydrazones 14 using Cu(OAc)2·H2O as the catalyst, as can be seen in Scheme 5. Compared to Tang’s methods, this approach proceeded at lower temperatures with lower catalyst loading. As an example, Bunce et al. [20] recently explored an efficient route to substituted 1-aryl-1H-indazoles 17 (Scheme 6). This transformation involved the preparation of arylhydrazones, followed by deprotonation and nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) ring closure. Notably, treatment of bromoacetophenone and bromobenzaldehyde with ArNHNH2·HCl and 30 wt% of powdered 4 Å molecular sieves in the presence of CuI and K2CO3 also afforded the desired compounds in good yields.

The synthesis of 1H-indazoles 20 from pyrazoles 18 and internal alkynes 19 via Pd(OAc)2/P(tBu)3·HBF4 mediated oxidative benzannulation was achieved by Joo et al. (Scheme 7) [21]. Under the optimized conditions, the corresponding 1H-indazoles possessing different substituents on the benzene ring were constructed in moderate to good yields. Joo et al. [22] also disclosed another synthesis method for 1H-indazoles 24 using a sequence reaction, as shown in Scheme 8. They carried out the regioselective dialkenylation of pyrazoles 21 with electron-deficient alkenes 22 in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and Ag2CO3. A sequence involving thermal 6π-electrocyclization of dialkenyl pyrazoles and oxidation afforded the desired products.

Zhu et al. [23] present a simple and efficient strategy to afford 1H-indazoles 26 from readily available aldehyde phenylhydrazones 25 through Rh(III)-promoted double C-H activation and C-H/C-H cross coupling (Scheme 9). The reaction tolerated a range of functional groups and lead to the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. 

An efficient and general method to build up 1H-indazoles 29 by Cu(OAc)2-mediated N-N bond formation using oxygen as the sole oxidant was reported by Chen et al. [24] (Scheme 10). Ketimine species as the key intermediates for this reaction were easily prepared from o-aminobenzonitriles 27 and organometallic reagents. The cyclization of ketamine 28 performed by using Cu(OAc)2 in the presence of oxygen efficiently converted the desired products in good to excellent yields.

Li et al. [25] accomplished a rhodium and copper catalyzed C-H activation and C-N/N-N coupling of imidate esters or NH imines with nitrosobenzenes 31 to 1H-indazoles 32 (Scheme 11). In this transformation, the desired products were obtained under redox-neutral conditions in good yields. In the same year, they [26] observed that 1H-indazoles can be synthesized via rhodium-catalyzed amination using anthranil as an aminating reagent under both redox-neutral and oxidative conditions (Scheme 12). With this method, a series of bifunctional products were prepared in good to excellent yields. Both of these two examples involved expensive rhodium catalyst. To address this issue, they [27] explored a synergistic cobalt and copper catalytic system using a similar process to give 1H-indazoles 35 (Scheme 12). In this work, anthranil served as both an aminating reagent and organic oxidant. The reactions tolerated various functional groups and good yields were observed.

Peng et al. [28] developed a strategy to access 3-aryl/alkyl-1H-indazoles 38 by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of α-diazomethylphosphonates 36 with o-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate 37 in the presence of CsF (Scheme 13). In addition, this transformation provided moderate to excellent yields.

2.2. Synthesis of 2H-Indazole
Nazaré et al. [29] demonstrated an organophosphorus-mediated reductive cyclization and a subsequent N-N bond formation of substituted benzamidines 40 to construct 3-amino-2H-indazoles 41 (Scheme 14a). The substituted benzamidines 40 were synthesized from 2-nitrobenzonitriles 39 through a two-step sequence involving a trimethylaluminium-mediated conversion. The reaction showed good functional group tolerance and satisfactory yields could be obtained. Later, the same group [30] reported a one-pot, two-step approach to generate 2H-indazol-2-amines 44 via a reductive cyclization of substituted hydrazones precursors 43 in the presence of organophosphorus reagent (Scheme 14b). In this process, substituted hydrazones 43 were easily prepared from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde 42 and phenylhydrazine.

Radosevich et al. [31] developed a useful method to construct 2H-indazoles 46 from o-nitrobenzaldimines 45 improved by 1,2,2,3,4,4-hexamethylphosphetane (Scheme 15a). In their work, o-nitrobenzaldimines 45 underwent deoxygenative N-N bond forming cadogan heterocyclization to provide desired products 46 in the presence of 1,2,2,3,4,4-hexamethylphosphetane and hydrosilane terminal reductant. This approach showed good functional group compatibility. The proposed mechanism revealed that the reaction proceeded via catalytic PIII/PIV=O redox cycling. According to the DFT calculation, (3 + 1) cheletropic addition between the phosphetane catalyst and nitroarene substrate was a turnover-limiting step. Recently, Nazaré et al. [32] reported a one-pot, two-step method to prepare 2H-indazoles 49 from 2-nitrobenzaldehydes 47 and amines 48 by domino imine condensation/reductive cyclization in the presence of organophosphorus reagent (Scheme 15b). Similar to Radosevich’s prior work, the organophosphorus agents generated in situ via a redox process from phospholene oxide with organosilanes. The protocol was carried out at 110 °C, tolerating various carboxylic acids, boronic esters, protected amines, phenols to give cyclization products in good yields. In the same year, Nazaré et al. [33] discovered a SnCl2·H2O mediated reductive cyclization to afford 3-perfluoroalkylated-2H-indazoles 54 from α-prefluoroalkylated benzylamine 53 (Scheme 16). This protocol involved the preparation of precursors 52 from 2-nitrobenzaldehydes 50 and anilines 51, followed by reductive cyclization.

Ellman et al. [34] reported a practical bench-top reaction for the synthesis of N-aryl-2H-indazoles 57 through Cp*Co(III)-promoted C-H bond functionalization/addition/cyclization cascades (Scheme 17). In this work, treatment of azobenzenes 55 and aldehydes 56 with [Cp*Co(C6H6)][B(C6F5)4]2 and AcOH in 1,4-dioxane at 100 °C led to the corresponding products with moderate to excellent yields. This reaction tolerated a wide range of functional groups and was successfully carried out on a large scale. A similar approach was used by Wang et al. [35] for the synthesis of 2H-indazoles 57 via a re-catalyzed C-H transformation of azobenzenes 55 and aldehydes 56 (Scheme 17). It should be mentioned that this reaction is a good example of using isolabe cyclic ReI-complex as the catalyst. Remarkably, mechanistic studies disclosed that the aldehyde-insertion step was irreversible in the catalytic cycle.

The cyclization of azobenzenes 58 with α-keto aldehydes 59 was also realized by Kim et al. [36] using rhodium (III) catalyst (Scheme 18a). This process provided an efficient method to synthesize 3-acylated-2H-indazoles 60 via functionalization of C (sp2)-H bond in moderate to high yields. A tandem C-H activation/intramolecular annulation reaction between azobenzenes 61 with sulfoxonium ylides 62 for the synthesis 3-acylated-2H-indazoles 63 was reported by the same group (Scheme 18b) [37]. In contrast to the reaction conditions in the previous work, Cu(OAc)2 and CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 were utilized instead of AgOAc. In this process, the target products were synthesized with a wide range of substrate scope in good yields.

Xi et al. [38] reported rhodium (III)-catalyzed C-H functionalization of azobenzenes 64 with acrylates 65 to furnish the corresponding 2H-indazoles 66 in the presence of Cu(OAc)2 with good functional group tolerance and satisfying yields (Scheme 19). Notably, copper acetate played an important role for β-hydride elimination during the course of transformation.

You et al. [39] discovered a rhodium (III)-catalyzed tandem C-H alkylation/intramolecular decarboxylative cyclization that used azoxy compounds 67 and diazoesters 68 for the synthesis of 3-acyl-2H-indazoles 69 (Scheme 20a). In this reaction, azoxy compounds 67 reacted with diazoesters 68 under the catalysis of [Cp*RhCl2]2 in the presence of AgSbF6 to furnish the corresponding 2 H-indazoles products with a broad functional group tolerance. Another example regarding the application of similar strategy for the synthesis of 2H-indazoles 72 was disclosed by the same group (Scheme 20b) [40]. Under the modified catalytic system, azoxy compounds 70 and alkynes 71 underwent C-H activation/cyclization cascades to provide 2H-indazoles 72 in good yields.

Lin et al. [41] introduced a Cu/Pd cooperatively catalyzed tandem C-N and C-P bonds formation reaction of 2-alkynyl azobenzenes 73 and compounds 74 for the construction of 2H-indazoles 75 (Scheme 21). In this approach, the phosphorated 2H-indazoles were synthesized in moderate to good yields, displaying good functional groups tolerance.

Xi et al. [42] developed an efficient iodine-mediated synthesis of 2H-indazoles 77 from ortho-alkylazobenzenes 76 via benzyl C-H functionalization (Scheme 22). With this method, a variety of 2H-indazoles bearing various functional groups were prepared in moderate to good yields. Mechanism studies suggested iodine assisted hydrogen transfer from the benzylic position to nitrogen. DFT calculations revealed that it was a radical chain mechanism. Subsequently, the same group [43] expanded the scope of the substrates. Under similar reaction conditions, using CuI as oxidation promotor and oxygen as a terminal oxidant, ortho-alkylazobenzenes could be converted to corresponding products via C-H bond functionalization with high yields.

Cheng et al. [44] disclosed a copper-mediated method for the annulation of 2-(1-substituted vinyl) anilines 79 with aryl nitrosos 80 for the synthesis of 2,3-aryl-2H-indazoles 80 (Scheme 23). The reaction took place at 130 °C with Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst, O2 as an oxidant in DMSO, affording the desired products.

3. Biological Applications of Indazole Derivatives
3.1. Antitumor Activity
Paul et al. [45,46] reported the synthesis of a series of (1R,2S)-2-(1H-indazol-6-yl)spiro [cyclopropane-1,3′-indolin]-2′-one derivatives based on previous bioisosteric scaffold and evaluated their possible potential against Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) (Figure 3). As a result, compounds 81a, 81b, and 81c were single-digit nanomolar PLK4 inhibitors. In particular, compound 81c (CFI-400945) was an effective inhibitor of HCT116 tumor growth in a mouse model of colon cancer and was identified as a novel clinical candidate for cancer therapy.

Wang et al. [47] described the synthesis of novel 1H-indazole derivatives based on systematic optimization of both the piperidine and 2,6-difluorophenyl moieties of 3-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-indazole as potential inhibitors of pan-Pim kinases (Figure 4). The vitro assay study revealed that among the synthesized and tested compounds, 82a possessed the strongest activity against Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3 with IC50 values of 0.4, 1.1 and 0.4 nM, respectively. Meanwhile, compound 82a showed moderate cellular potency in KMS-12 BM cell assays with an IC50 value of 1400 nM.

Kolesnikov et al. [48] presented the synthesis and evaluation of anti-tumor activity of new 6-azaindazole derivatives. According to the fragment-based approach, they optimized 6-azaindazoles as desirable cores with picomolar biochemical potency against all three Pim kinases, resulting in good cellular potency. Among the synthesized derivatives, compound 83 was the most balanced profile in terms of potency and stability in vivo and was one of the lead compounds in the series. They also found that compound 83 possessed potent antiproliferative activity against the MM1.S multiple myeloma cell line with IC50 value of 0.64 μM (Figure 5).

Wang et al. [49] designed and synthesized a novel series of azaindazole derivatives, which were tested as inhibitors of pan-Pim Kinases. It was found that compounds 84 possessed the strongest activity against Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3 with Ki values of 0.03, 0.11 and 0.02 nM, respectively (Figure 6). In particular, 84 was relatively impotent in a two-point hERG patch clamp assay, exhibiting moderate 37% Pim inhibition at 1 μM and 49% Pim inhibition at 10 μM.

Indazole-based series of selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) were reported by Govek et al. [50]. A structure-activity relationship study of synthesized derivatives based on compound 85 (Figure 7) revealed that when replacing the ethyl with cyclobutyl group, the corresponding analogs displayed enhanced potency. However, incorporating larger substituents on para--position of the upper aryl ring, such as CF3, the corresponding compounds showed improved degradation efficacy. They also discovered that by tempering the polarity of lipophilic acids and incorporation of the 3-fluoroindazole motifs, oral bioavailability could be increased. Ultimately, compounds 86 and 87, which were identified by exploration of ER degradation and antagonism in vitro followed by in vivo antagonism and culminating in oral exposure, could induce tumor regression in a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer xenograft.

The same year, Smith et al. [51] identified a series of 1H-indazole derivatives as orally bioavailable estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) based on SAR studies on a triphenylalkene scaffold (Figure 8). Among the optimized compounds, 88 was the most efficient degrader of the ER-α with an IC50 value of 0.7 nM (Figure 8). Furthermore, 88 exhibited good bioavailability across species and displayed robust activity in tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant xenograft models of breast cancer.

Wang et al. [52] synthesized a series of 1H-indazol-3-amine derivatives and evaluated their activity against Bcr-Abl wild type as well as T315I mutant. Among these compounds, 89 and 90 appeared to be the most potent Bcr-Abl inhibitors (Figure 9). In particular, compound 89 served as a promising inhibitor, which exhibited comparable potency with that of Imatinib and inhibited Bcr-AblWT, Bcr-AblT315I and K562 leukemia cancer cells with IC50 values of 0.014, 0.45 and 6.50 μM, respectively. The docking studies indicated that compound 89 bound to Bcr-AblWT in a similar manner as imatinib.

A novel series of 3-(pyrrolopyridin-2-yl)indazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-proliferative effects on five human cancer cell lines (HL60, KB, SMMC-7721, HCT116, and A549) by Hu et al. [53]. The study revealed that all of the synthesized compounds exhibited vigorous potency against HL60 cell line with IC50 values ranging from singe digital nanomolar to micromolar level. Among them, compound 93 was identified to be the most potent inhibitor, with IC50 values of 8.3 nM and 1.3 nM against HL60 and HCT116 cell lines, respectively (Figure 10). Furthermore, results of the inhibitory activities against a panel of kinases demonstrated that compounds 91, 92 and 93 could selectivity inhibit CHK1, CDK2, MEK1, GSK3β, BRAF, IKKβ and PKC. 

Pauls et al. [54] synthesized a new set of 3-(4-(heterocyclyl)phenyl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxamides derivatives, which were tested as inhibitors of tyrosine threonine kinase (TTK). It was found that compounds 94, 95 (designated CFI-401870) and 96 were single-digit nanomolar TTK inhibitors, with acceptable off-target activity and good oral bioavailability in rodents (Figure 11). In particular, compound 95 served as the most efficacious of the shortlisted compounds in an HCT116 tumor xenograft model, which also could inhibit the growth of a broad panel of human cancer cell lines including breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, lung and melanoma cell lines. 

Qu et al. [55] performed anticancer activities screening assays as well as cancer growth inhibitory studies on previously synthesized N-(4-(1-(4-chlorineindazole))phenyl)-N-(4-chloro-3-tri fluoromethyl phenyl) urea 97 (Figure 12). The results indicated that compound 97 could be a multi-kinases inhibitor targeting c-Kit, PDGFRβ and FLT3 with Kd values at 68.5 ± 9.5 nM, 140 ± 0 nM and 375 ± 15.3 nM, respectively. Compound 97 also possessed strong inhibition activities against 12 human cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 1.12 to 6.84 μM. Especially, it exhibited strong inhibition on SK-MEL-3, NB-4, and SK-MEL-31 with IC50 values at 1.12 ± 0.06 μM, 1.34 ± 0.20 μM, and 1.77 ± 0.06 μM, respectively. Meanwhile, compound 97 effectively delayed the growth of cancer xenografts and safety to mice [56].

Li et al. [57] designed and synthesized a novel series of 1H-indazol-3-amine scaffold derivatives by utilizing scaffold hopping and molecular hybridization strategies aiming to develop potent FGFR inhibitors. The authors carried out an evaluation of their inhibitory activity against FGFR1. It was found that 6-(3-methoxyphenyl)-1H-indazol-3-amine derivative 98 was a promising FGFR1 inhibitor, exihibited good enzymatic inhibition (IC50 = 15.0 nM) and modest anti-proliferative activity (IC50 = 642.1 nM) (Figure 13). Further structural optimization revealed that compound 99 was identified as the most potent FGFR1 inhibitor with the best enzyme inhibitory (IC50 = 2.9 nM) and cellular activity (IC50 = 40.5 nM). The SAR studies revealed that N-ethylpiperazine group was important for enzyme inhibitory and cellular activity.

As a continuation of their research to improve the cellular activity of hit compound 100 bearing an indazole scaffold, a series of new compounds harnessing fluorine substituents were designed, synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of the above enzyme by Li et al. [58]. Among them, compound 100 containing 2,6-difluoro-3-methoxyphenyl group, possessed the most enzymatic and antiproliferative activities (FGFR1: IC50 value less than 4.1 nM, FGFR2: IC50 = 2.0 ± 0.8 nM, KG1 cell lines: IC50 = 25.3 ± 4.6 nM, SNU16 cell lines: IC50 = 77.4 ± 6.2 nM) (Figure 14).

Zhao et al. [59] disclosed novel 6-(2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-substituted-1H-indazole derivatives and assessed their potency as tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors for cancer therapy. The results indicated that compound 101 was a potent FGFR1 inhibitor, with good enzymatic inhibition (IC50 = 69.1 ± 19.8 nM) (Figure 15). According to the obtained structure activity relationship, the authors further designed and synthesized a new series of derivatives. 6-(2,6-Dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(3-(4–methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl)-1H-indazole-4-carboxamide (102) exhibited the most potent FGFR1 inhibitory activity in the enzymatic assay (IC50 = 30.2 ± 1.9 nM).

Liu et al. [60] reported that the synthesis of pyridin-3-amine derivatives served as multi-targeted protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First, they discovered compound 103 via in silico screening against fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) and this was sequentially validated by in vitro experiments (IC50 value of 3.8 ± 0.5 μM against FGFR1). Aiming to improve the inhibition potency of compound 103 against FGFR1, the authors carried out a structure-based structural optimization, and then explored further to afford novel FGFR inhibitors (Figure 16). Among them, compound 104 displayed attractive inhibitory activity against FGFR1, 2 and 3 with IC50 values of 18.0, 1.6 and 27.5 nM, respectively. Notably, compound 104 also exhibited nanomolar level inhibition against several other NSCLC-related oncogenes kinases, such as RET, EGFR, EGFR/T790M/L858R, DDR2, and ALK. Significant antitumor activity (TGI = 66.1%) of compound 104 in FGFR-driven NCI-H1581 xenografts with good PK profiles was observed in vivo pharmacology evaluations.

Duan et al. [61] reported the synthesis of novel 3-(5′-Substituted)–Benzimidazole-5-(1-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)ethoxy)-1H-indazole derivatives and evaluated for Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) inhibitory activities. Among them, compound 105 was identified as a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor (FGFR1-4 IC50 values of 0.9, 2.0, 2.0, and 6.1 nM, respectively) (Figure 17). Moreover, compound 105 provided nearly complete inhibition of tumor growth (96.9% TGI) in NCI-H1581 (FGFR1-amplified) xenograft mice model at the dose of 10 mg/kg/qd via oral administration. 

Fishwick et al. [62] discovered a novel series of 1H-indazole-based derivatives for the inhibition of Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) kinases using fragment-led de novo design. Biological evaluation indicated that these 1H-indazole-based derivatives inhibited FGFR1-3 in the range of 0.8–90 μM with excellent ligand (LE) efficiencies of 0.30–0.48. Among them, compound 106 was identified as the most active inhibitor (FGFR1-3 IC50 values of 2.0 ± 0.4, 0.8 ± 0.3 and 4.5 ± 1.6 μM, respectively) (Figure 18).

Rauh et al. [63] described a structure-based approach, rationalized by subsequent computational analysis of conformational ligand ensembles in solution, to design 1H-indazole analogues as irreversible and mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors based on systematic optimization of 80 NSCLC cell lines against approximately 1500 compounds. The vitro assay study revealed that among the synthesized and tested compounds, 107 was the most active compound against the L858R/T790M double mutant of EGFR with IC50 values of 0.07 μM. Meanwhile, 107 exhibited moderate effects on the activating and drug resistant cell lines HCC827 and H1975 (GI50 = 2.5 μM and 9.8 μM, respectively) (Figure 19).

A series of 1H-indazole derivatives were synthesized using structure-guided drug design from lead compound 108 by Liu et al. [64] and evaluated for their epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity. The results indicated that compound 109 displayed strong potencies against EGFR T790M and EGFR kinases with IC50 values of 5.3 and 8.3 nM, respectively (Figure 20). In particular, compound 109 displayed strong antiproliferative effects against EGFR mutant-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines such as H1975, PC9, HCC827, and H3255 without obvious toxicity.

Hah et al. [65] reported the synthesis of novel 3-carboxamido-2H-indazole-6-arylamide derivatives as selective CRAF inhibitors. The compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against the WM3629 melanoma cell line. Results revealed that most of the compounds displayed potent antiproliferative activity against the WM3629 melanoma cell line. In particular, compounds 110 and 111 exhibited superior selectivity (Figure 21). Compound 110 was found to be the most promising inhibitor against the WM3629 melanoma cell line with IC50 value of 38.6 nM, which also showed enzymatic activities against wild-type BRAF and BRAF (V599E) kinase with IC50 values of 9.45 and 7.82 μM, respectively.

Schiemann et al. [66] synthesized a series of 3-benzylindazoles analogues based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign sampling the Merck compound collection, which were tested as potent and selective CDK8 inhibitors with high affinity to CDK19. Medicinal chemistry optimization allowed them to identify inhibitors with improved potency, physicochemical properties and oral pharmacokinetics. Compound 112 displayed promising selectivity against CDK8 with IC50 value of 53 nM (Figure 22).

Czodrowski et al. [67] described a series of imidazo-thiadiazole derivatives as CDK8 inhibitors based on a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Lanthascreen binding competition assay. In several optimization cycles, compounds 113 displayed excellent kinase selectivity (CDK8 IC50 = 2.6 nM), biochemical and cellular potency, microsomal stability (Figure 23). In particular, compound 113 demonstrated reduction of tumor growth rates of established human SW620 colorectal carcinoma xenografts using two different oral dosing schedules.

Mallinger et al. [68] disclosed a novel series of 1H-indazole derivatives and the application of physicochemical property analyses to successfully reduce in vivo metabolic clearance, minimize transporter-mediated biliary elimination while maintaining acceptable aqueous solubility.

Among them, (S)-3-fluoropyrrolidine 195 exhibited good activity at Nav1.7 (FRET IC50 = 0.37 μM, EP IC50 = 0.48 μM; manual EP IC50 = 0.57 μM), good selectivity versus Nav1.5 (>33 μM) and good pharmacokinetic properties (F = 83%; t1/2 = 1.7 h) (Figure 68). Compound 196 demonstrated moderate activity at Nav1.7 in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay (FRET IC50 = 3.9 μM), excellent metabolic stability and good PK properties, but no activity at Nav1.5. In addition, compound 196 exhibited good activity in the acute rat mono-iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis model at 10 and 30 mg/kg (EC50 = 2.5 μg/mL).

Utilizing a hybrid approach, Larsen et al. [119] prepared a novel series of 1H-indazole derivatives as potent and selective G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) inhibitors. Among them, compound 197 was the most selective compound, which had an IC50 for GRK2 of 130 nM and no detectable inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 1 (ROCK1) (Figure 69). Co-crystal structures revealed that compound 197 binded snugly in the hydrophobic subsite of GRK2 with one methoxy group packing deep in the pocket.

Lorthiois et al. [120] reported the synthesis of a novel series 1H-indazole hybrids and investigated their potencies of factor D (FD). During the optimization, compound 198 showed more potent inhibitory activity against FD with an IC50 value of 0.006 μM in the in vitro membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition assay (Figure 70). Moreover, compound 198 displayed an excellent oral pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in Sprague−Dawley rats and, following an oral dose (10 mg/kg) in Brown Norway rats, demonstrated a good distribution and sustained exposure in ocular tissues including the neural retina and the posterior eye cup (PEC), which comprises the sclera, retinal pigmented epithelium, and choroid.

Read et al. [121] described the synthesis of a series of 2H-indazoles which were investigated for their trypanosoma brucei N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) inhibition efficiencies. The studies revealed that, among the synthesized and tested derivatives, 199 possessed the most potent inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.006 μM (Figure 71). In addition, compound 199 had good potency against the T. brucei parasite (EC50 = 5 nM), good microsomal stability (Cli = 2.9 mL/min/g), good selectivity (“S” = 47), good oral exposure, and good in vivo tolerability.

4. Conclusions
Indazole and its analogues are important scaffolds with a broad range of pharmacological activities. There has been an escalating interest in the development of compounds bearing indazole moiety against different kinds of diseases. Various bioactive moieties can easily be incorporated into indazole derivatives and a great amount of effort has been dedicated to the exploration of medicinal approaches for their preparation and evaluation of their biological activities. The present review not only updates recent developments in new reactions for the synthesis of indazole derivatives and their application in the medicinal field but also encourages medicinal chemists to further explore novel indazoles as potential drug candidates for useful therapeutics.
