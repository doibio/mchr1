==== Body
1. Introduction
Quinazolines and quinazolinones are classes of fused heterocycles that are of considerable interest because of the diverse range of their biological properties [1]. Many substituted quinazoline and quinazolinone derivatives possess a wide range of bioactivities such as antimalarial, anticancer, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoan, anti-inflammatory, diuretic, muscle relaxant, antitubercular, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, acaricidal, weedicide, and many other biological activities. Quinazoline and quinazolinone compounds are also used in preparation of various functional materials for synthetic chemistry and also present in various drugs molecules (Figure 1). This review is an attempt to expand the huge potentiality and focused on the various biological activities of quinazolines and quinazolinones [2].

Quinazolinones will be classified into the following five categories, based on the substitution patterns of the ring system [3]. These are 2-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones, 3-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones, 4-substituted-quinazolines, 2,3-disubstituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones, and 2,4-disubstituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones. Depending upon the position of the keto or oxo group, these compounds may be classified into three types [4]. Out of the three (2(1H)quinazolinones, 4(3H)quinazolinones and 2,4(1H,3H)quinazolinedione) quinazolinone structures, 4(3H)-quinazolinones are most prevalent, either as intermediates or as natural products in many proposed biosynthetic pathways (see Scheme 1).

This is partly due to the structure being derived from the anthranilates (anthranilic acid or various esters, isatoic anhydride, anthranilamide, and anthranilonitrile) while the 2(1H)-quinazolinone is predominantly a product of anthranilonitrile or benzamides with nitriles [4].

2. History
In 1869 Griess prepared the first quinazoline derivative, 2-cyano-3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazoline, by the reaction of cyanogens with anthranilic acid. The bicyclic product was called bicyanoamido benzoyl and used this name until 1885 [5]. The preparation of the quinazoline came many years later when Bischler and Lang obtained it by decarboxylation of the 2-carboxy derivative. A more satisfactory synthesis of quinazoline was subsequently devised by Gabriel in 1903. The name was proposed by Widdege. Other names such as phenmiazine, benzyleneamidine, benzo-1,3-diazine, 5,6-benzopyrimidine, and 1,3-diazanapthaline have occasionally been used. The presence of a fused benzene ring alters the properties of the pyrimidine ring considerably. The two nitrogen atoms are not equivalent, and the marked polarization of the 3,4-double bond is reflected in the reactions of quinazoline. The properties of substitute's quinazolines depend largely on (a) the nature of the substituents, (b) whether they are in the pyrimidine ring or in the benzene ring, and (c) whether or not complete conjugation is present in the pyrimidine ring [6–8] (see Scheme 2).

3. Chemical Properties of Quinazolines
The chemistry of quinazoline was reviewed by Williamson in 1957 and then by Lindquist in 1959 and brought up to date by Armarego in 1963.

Quinazolines is stable in cold dilute acid and alkaline solutions, but it is destroyed when these solutions are boiled. O-Aminobenzaldehyde, ammonia, and formic acid are formed when quinazoline is boiled with hydrochloric acid.

3.1. Hydrolysis, Oxidation, and Reduction
Oxidation of quinazoline in dilute aqueous acid with two equivalents of hydrogen peroxide at room temperature gave 3,4-dihydro-4-oxo quinazoline. In alkaline medium, the anhydrous neutral species of quinazoline were predominantly undergo oxidation with KMnO4 and yielded 3,4-dihydro-6 4-oxo quinazoline.

3.1.1. Oxidation
Catalytic hydrogenation of quinazoline stopped after the absorption of one molecule of hydrogen and gave 3,4-dihydro quinazoline (see Scheme 3).

3.1.2. Reduction
Reduction with sodium amalgam gave 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazoline. Lithium aluminum hydride and sodium borohydride gave 3,4-dihydro and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazoline (see Scheme 4).

3.2. Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Substitution Reactions
The two known nucleophilic substitution reactions of quinazoline are sodamide and hydrazine most probably proceed via the intermediate addition products, and gave 4-amino and 4-hydrazine quinazoline (see Scheme 5).

3.2.1. Electrophilic Substitution Reaction of Quinazoline
Nitration is the only known electrophilic substitution reaction of quinazoline. The expected order of reactivity is at positions 8 > 6 > 5 > 7 > 4 > 2. Quinazoline gives 6-nitroquinazoline with fuming nitric acid in concentrated H2SO4. No oxidation of the heterocyclic ring can occur under these conditions because the hydrated cation is not present (see Scheme 6).

3.3. Alkylation Reactions
Alkylation of quinazoline takes place on N atom, 3-methyl, 3-ethyl-3-alkyl, and 3-benzylquinazolinium salts that readily take up a molecule of alcohol to form the corresponding 4-alkoxy-3-alkyl-3,4-dihydro quinazolinium salts. These salts gave the pseudo bases, 3-alkyl-3,4-dihydro-4-hydroxy quinazolines on treatment with strong alkali (see Scheme 7).

3.4. Addition Reactions
Quinazoline is highly reactive towards anionic reagents which attack on position 4. Sodium bisulphate, hydrogen cyanide, acetone, 2-butanone, acetophenone, and cyclohexanone add across the 3,4-double bond of quinazoline. Methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, benzyl, t-butyl, and phenyl magnesium halides and phenyl lithium also add across the 3,4-double bond to give the corresponding 4-substituted 3,4-dihydroquinazolines.

4. Synthesis of Quinazoline Compounds
Various methods were reported for the synthesis of oxoquinazolines.

4.1. Niementowski's Synthesis
Compound 3 or 4-substituted anthranilic acid when reacted with formamide at 125–130°C gave 3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazoline (see Scheme 8).

4.2. Grimmel, Guinther, and Morgan's Synthesis
The o-amino benzoic acids, when heated with an amine together with phosphorous trichloride in toluene for two hours, gave 2,3-disubstituted 3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazolines (see Scheme 9).

4.3. From Isatoic Anhydride
Isatoic anhydride was readily reacted with amines to dihydro-4-oxoquinazolines by refluxing ethyl orthoformate for 1–6 hrs without isolating the intermediate amides (see Scheme 10).

4.4. From 3,1,4-Benoxazones (Acylanthranils) and Amines
3,1,4-Benoxazones react with amines to give 3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazolines. Primary aliphatic amines and anilines react with 2-methyl-5-nitro-4-oxoquinazolines (see Scheme 11).

4.5. From Ethyl 2-Acetamido-5-nitrobenzoate
Ethyl 2-acetamido-5-nitrobenzene and alcoholic ammonia when heated gave 3,4-dihydro-methyl-6-nitro-4-oxoquinazoline (see Scheme 12).

4.6. Sen and Ray's Synthesis
Boiling a solution of normal or isobutyrylanilides with urethane and phosphorous pentoxide in xylene gave 2-propyl and 2-isopropyl-3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazolines (see Scheme 13).

5. Methods for the Synthesis of Quinazoline and Quinazolinone Derivatives (Benzoylene Urea)
Some methods were reported for the synthesis of quinazolines and quinazolinones are as follows.

5.1. From Anthranilic Acid and Urea
The fusion of anthranilic acid with urea gave 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline (see Scheme 14).

5.2. From O-Ureidobenzoic Acid
The o-ureidobenzoic acids are prepared from the corresponding anthranilic acid and potassium cyanate. The ureido acids are then easily cyclized to the respective 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazolines by heating with acid or alkali (see Scheme 15).

5.3. From O-Ethoxy Carbonylaminobenzoic Esters or Amides
When o-ethoxycarbonylamino benzamide and its 4-methyl derivatives are heated over their melting points, then they lose water and form 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline (see Scheme 16).

5.4. From Phthalic Acid Derivatives
The derivatives of phthalic acid used for the preparation of dioxoquinazoline necessitate rearrangement of the Hoffmann Curties or Lossan type. Reaction of phthalamide or phthalimide, N-methyl, and N-ethyl phthalimide with alkali hypobromite gives the 1,2,3,4-tetrehydro 2,4-dioxoquinazoline (see Scheme 17).

5.5. From Isatins

α-Isatin oxime rearranges to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline on heating with dilute sodium hydroxide; β-imino derivatives of isatin, on the other hand, require oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in alkaline solution in order to form the dioxoquinazoline (see Scheme 18).

5.6. From 2-Aminobenzylamine
The 2-aminobenzylamine reacts with butyrolactone which involves forming intermediate compound and further condensed with benzaldehyde to give 3-(2-chlorobenzylidene)-1,2,3,9-tetrahydropyrrolo-2-quinazoline (see Scheme 19).

5.7. From 2-Azido-4-chlorobenzoic Acid
The 2-azido-4-chlorobenzoic acid reacts with benzyl nitrile and formed 7-chloro-3-phenyl-[1,2, 3]triazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline-5-one [9] (see Scheme 20).

Condensation of o-iodobenzaldehydes with amidine hydrochlorides under ligand-free copper catalyzed Ullmann N-arylation conditions afforded the corresponding quinazolines [10]. Treatment of benzoxazine with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol prepared 3-amino-2-phenyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one, which upon condensation with aldehydes gives the corresponding 3-arylidenoamino derivatives. Cyclization of these derivatives using mercaptosuccinic acid afforded 1,3-thiazolidin-4-one ethanolic acid, which after esterfication with N-hydroxyphthalimide or N-hydroxysuccinamide via acid chlorides produced the respective ethanolic esters [11]. A series of quinoxalin-2(1H)-one-3-hydrazone derivatives were synthesized via condensation of 3-hydrazinoquinoxalin-2(1H)-one with the corresponding ketones under microwave irradiation and gave hydrazones in high yield in less reaction time compared to conventional method [12]. The (hydroxyimino)(2-phenyl(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-2-yl)) methane and (hydroxyimino) (2-(2-thienyl)(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro quinazolin-2-yl)) methane were synthesized by the condensation of 2-(hydroxyimino)-1-phenylethan-1-one and 2-(hydroxyimino)-1-(2-thienyl) ethan-1-one with 2-aminobenzylamine (2-ABA). Complexes of these ligands with Co3+ were prepared with a metal: ligand ratio of 1 : 2 [13]. The [4+2]cycloaddition between 2,4-diphenylpyrimidine ortho-quinodimethane and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate leads to 2,4-diphenylquinazoline-6,7-dicarboxylate. 2,4-Diphenylfuro [3,4-g]quinazoline-6,8-dione is also obtained by basic hydrolysis of compound, followed by the closure of the resulting diacid in acetic anhydride [14]. A series of triazoloquinazolinones and benzimidazoquinazolinones has been achieved under microwave irradiation by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes with 5-amino-1(H)-1,2,4-triazole (or 2-aminobenzimidazole) and dimedone in DMF [15].

6. Biological Importance of Quinazoline Derivatives
The quinazoline and quinazolinone skeleton is frequently encountered in medicinal chemistry. The various substituted quinazolines and quinazolinones are having significant antihypertensive, antineoplastic, antidepressant, and antipsychotic activities whereas some derivatives of quinazoline and quinazolinones are found to be effective agents such as analgesic, antipsychotic, antiarrhythmic, sedative hypnotics, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antimalarial, anticonvulsant, anticoccidial, anti-Parkinsonism, cancer and other activities [6–8].

Microwave-assisted synthesis and the SAR studies of modified 9-oxo-thia-zolo[5,4-f] quinazoline-2-carbonitriles allowed identification of new amidine and imidate derivatives as potent and dual CDK1/GSK-3 inhibitors. Combination of lead optimization and molecular modeling studies allowed a dual CDK1/GSK-3 inhibitor with submicromolar values [35]. Novel 2,3-disubstituted quinazoline-4(3H)-ones (43) were screened for cytotoxicity and for antiviral activity against influenza A [36]. The 6-Arylbenzimidazo [1,2-c]quinazoline derivatives were act as a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production inhibitors. These compounds were tested for their in vitro ability to inhibit the lipolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-α secretion in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60. The compound 6-Phenyl-benzimidazo [1,2-c]quinazoline, coded as G1, resulted as the most potent inhibitor and with no significant cytotoxic activity. Thus, 6-arylbenzimidazo [1,2-c]quinazoline derivatives may have a potential as anti-inflammatory agents [37]. Docking studies of few synthesized 6,7-dialkoxy-4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives which showed EGFR-TK inhibitory activity were conducted [38].

The 3-[(2-hydroxy-quinolin-3-ylmethylene)-amino]-2-phenyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (56) and its metal (II) complexes were reported for their antimicrobial activity [46]. Some quinazoline derivatives (57) act as potential antimicrobial agents [47] (see Schemes 47 and 48).

Condensing 2-methyl/phenyl/chloro methyl disubstituted benzooxazine-4-one and 1-(2-amino ethyl)-4-substituted benzylidene-2-phenyl-1H-Imidazoles-5(4H)-one gave imidazolo-quinazoline-4-one derivatives. These compounds have shown promising antibacterial and antifungal activity [48]. The antibacterial activities of substituted quinazolines against bacterial strains E. coli, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, and S. aureus were investigated. The sensitivity of the gram positive bacteria to the tested quinazolines was higher than that of gram negative bacteria. The most effective of quinazoline structure series were condensed [1,2,4]triazoloquinazolines and 10H-[1,2,4]triazino[5,4-b]quinazolin-10-ones [49].

(S)-4-aminoquinazoline alcohols were found to be genotoxically safe at the tested concentrations. Among the tested (S)-4-aminoquinazoline alcohols, the best antimutagenic activity was obtained with a methyl derivative at 0.1 μg/plate dose [60].

A series of 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxobutylquinazoline (69) derivatives are reported for their anticoccidial activity [62] (see Schemes 53 and 54).

6.8. Anti-Inflammatory and Analgesics Agents

7. Discussion
Heterocyclic compound containing quinazoline and quinazolinone nucleus plays most important role in the field of medicinal chemistry. It shows wide range of activities for medication purpose. A large number of quinazoline compounds have been synthesized and evaluated for their different biological activities. Some marketed quinazoline and quinazolinone nucleus containing drugs have different types of pharmacological activities. The quinazoline and quinazolinone based pharmaceuticals are becoming very important class of therapeutic agents and are likely to replace many obtainable organic based pharmaceuticals in the very near future. The quinazoline and quinazolinone based pharmaceuticals will be created on a large scale by different research development processes and will become available commercially for therapeutic uses. The biological profiles of this new generation of quinazoline and quinazolinone represent much progress with regard to the older compounds. This study gets an efficient way of understanding about the target pharmacophore relationship which can further aid the process of drug design developments. This study may also accelerate the designing processes to generate a larger number of therapeutically active molecules. The molecular treatment of potentially lead molecules is still a major line of approaches for the discovery and development of new drug molecules [94–99]. Combination of two or more moieties into one is a general procedure of handling and this can probably result in the raise of biological activities and deduction of untoward side effects.

8. Conclusion
The various structural modifications around the fused ring of quinazoline and quinazolinone subsequently evaluate are for their usefulness in treating various disease conditions. Quinazoline and quinazolinone, being the central body of the pharmacophore, hold different types of substituent. Based on their various physicochemical properties, they exerted a diversified range of therapeutic efficacy. Thus we can conclude that this review will definitely provide the researchers with a thorough understanding of the structure activity relationship study, which further helps in designing good large number of quinazoline and quinazolinone compounds with a strong impact in curing many fatal disorders.
