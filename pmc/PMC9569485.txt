To develop potent and safer analgesics, we designed and synthesized a novel enantiomerically enriched ethereal analog of (R)-iso-moramide, namely 2-[(2R)-2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one. The titled active agent can potentially serve as a powerful synthetic opiate with an improved affinity and selectivity toward opioid receptors (ORs). This hypothesis was postulated based on docking studies regarding the respective complexes between the designed ligand and µ-OR, δ-OR, and κ-OR. The key step of the elaborated asymmetric synthesis of novel analog involves lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol, which was accomplished on a 10 g scale via an enantioselective transesterification employing vinyl acetate as an irreversible acyl donor in tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) as the co-solvent. Next, the obtained homochiral (S)-(+)-morpholino-alcohol (>99% ee) was functionalized into corresponding chloro-derivative using thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or the Appel reaction conditions. Further transformation with N-diphenylacetyl-1-pyrrolidine under phase-transfer catalysis (PTC) conditions using O2-saturated DMSO/NaOH mixture as an oxidant furnished the desired levorotatory isomer of the title product isolated in 26% total yield after three steps, and with 89% ee. The absolute configuration of the key-intermediate of (R)-(–)-iso-moramide was determined using a modified form of Mosher’s methodology. The preparation of the optically active dextrorotatory isomer of the titled product (87% ee) was carried out essentially by the same route, utilizing (R)-(–)-1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol (98% ee) as a key intermediate. The spectroscopic characterization of the ethereal analog of iso-moramide and the enantioselective retention relationship of its enantiomers using HPLC on the cellulose-based chiral stationary phase were performed. Moreover, as a proof-of-principle, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the synthesized 2-[(2R)-2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one is reported.

pmc1. Introduction

The treatment of chronic pain, including acute, post-traumatic, post-operative, post-heart attack, cancer and/or terminal pain is the critical domain of potent analgesics from the group of opioids (the so-called “drugs of the third rung of the WHO analgesic ladder”) [1]. Among the most notable examples of opiate analgesics, which belong to full agonists of µ-type opioid receptors, are morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, pethidine (meperidine), methadone, buprenorphine, tapentadol, levorphanol, and oxycodone [2,3]. Apart from the drugs mentioned above, dextromoramide (marketed under trade names: Palfium®, Jetrium®, Pyrrolamidol®, Dimorlin®, etc.) constitutes a potent synthetic opiate, which is structurally related to dextropropoxyphene, methadone, loperamide, and diphenoxylate (Figure 1).

Dextromoramide was introduced in 1956 by Dr. Paul Janssen [4,5,6,7], and shortly after discovering that it is a μ-agonist analgesic two to four times more powerful than morphine [8], it became a popular drug in pharmacologic pain therapy. Unfortunately, although dextromoramide is an ultra-efficient pharmaceutical against violent (intense) pain that standard doses of other opiates can hardly alleviate, it suffers from two major limitations: it is highly addictive and induces respiratory depression [9]. Therefore, a serious risk of dependence and apnoea caused by dextromoramide led us to develop a novel analog of this drug, which is envisioned to be a potentially more effective and safer analgesic with a much lower tolerability factor than the parent molecule. The desired analog, namely 2-[(2R)-2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one, was designed based on the in silico docking studies and further synthesized using (S)-1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol as the key intermediate. In turn, preparing this alcohol on a multi-gram scale and in enantiomerically pure form is a very useful task because it constitutes the critical precursor in the formal synthesis of dextromoramide and also represents a valuable template for other promising compounds that can interact with a large variety of biological targets. In this regard, the structural motif of 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol plays a crucial role in the synthesis of inhibitors of several enzymes, including acetylcholinesterase (ACE) [10,11], human neutrophil elastase [12], kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) [13,14], PI3 kinase [15], tyrosine Met kinase [16], etc. Moreover, the agonistic activity toward various receptors, including complement component 5a (C5a) [17], melanin-concentrating hormone (MCHr1) [18], subtype of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2C) [19], metabotropic glutamate (mGluR1) [20], G protein-coupled (GPR119) [21], oxytocin (OXTR) [22], 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B/1D) [23], metabotropic L-glutamate (mGluR2) [24], were discovered employing this scaffold. Recently, biologically active compounds possessing that particular morpholino-alcohol moiety were considered emerging drug candidates for diabetes mellitus [25]. Finally, the successful evaluations of 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol-based derivatives for their anti-hypertensive [26], anti-inflammatory [27], and lipid bi-layers membrane [28] activities show that there is a convincing potency for the application of this compound not only in the synthesis of non-morphinan painkillers but in a wider scope of medicinal chemistry as well.

In the present work, inspired by the unique analgetic properties of dextromoramide, a novel structural analog, potentially selective for κ-opioid receptors, and thus exhibiting reduced adverse pharmacological effects, was designed based on molecular docking studies and synthesized utilizing chemoenzymatic methodology. A critical synthetic step, including lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol, was optimized to achieve desired (R)-intermediate on a multigram scale. After further functionalization of the key precursor, the chemical structure and the absolute configuration of the novel (R)-iso-moramide analog was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Molecular Docking Studies

One of medicinal chemistry’s prime goals is to discover new opioid drug candidates with highly desirable features such as improved efficacy and specificity, increased duration of the activity, lower dosage, decreased adverse effects, and reduced risk of developing tolerance and/or addiction [29]. Unfortunately, the difficulty in obtaining selective modulators of opioid receptors (ORs) mainly stems from the phylogenetic proximity of the target proteins, leading to a high structural similarity—over 60% amino acid sequence identity was confirmed [30]. In this context, among the 14 essential amino acid residues found in highly specific orthosteric binding sites located around the top of the central channel formed by a typical 7-pass transmembrane α-helices, 9 of them are evolutionarily highly conserved among all three classical members of the opioid receptor family (µ-OR, δ-OR, and κ-OR) [31]. Moreover, in the case of µ- and δ-type receptors, the sequence similarity within the binding site is even more remarkable—the 11 amino acids out of 14 being identical.

From the point of view of the efficacy of pain inhibition, the mechanisms concerning interactions between endogenous and exogenous opioids, particularly µ-OR and δ-OR, play a significant role [32,33]. An effective stimulation of µ-OR and δ-OR has a complex effect on the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain relief, such as tachykinins, excitatory amino acids (EAA), neuropeptides (substance P (SP)), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) [34,35]. However, over-stimulation of µ-OR leads to life-threatening respiratory depression, which is not observed in the case of selective agonists of δ-OR and κ-OR. Moreover, selective κ-receptor antagonists, in addition to their proven analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties used in treating peritoneal symptoms or chronic neuropathic pain, also exhibit psychomimetic effects, allowing the treatment of drug-resistant depression, anxiety, social phobia or cocaine and nicotine dependency [36,37]. It is also important to mention that agonists of κ-OR with the most prominent examples, such as nalfurafine and difelikefalin (formerly CR845), are promising antipruritic (anti-itch) agents [38,39]. Therefore, ligands that display excellent selectivity and efficacy at kappa-opioid receptors (κ-OR) are highly desirable since they may overcome typical drawbacks regarding the side effects of opioid therapy in humans.

Intending to develop a novel selective non-morphinan kappa agonist, we have virtually screened a set of different ligands toward µ-OR (PDB ID: 4DKL [40]), δ-OR (PDB ID: 4EJ4 [41]), and κ-OR (PDB ID: 4DJH [42]), respectively. All the in silico studied ligands were designed based on dextromoramide as a lead structure. The preliminary results of molecular docking, obtained using non-commercial AutoDock Vina software (v1.1.2) [43], employing standard protocol for enzyme−ligand docking (for details, see Experimental Section 3), revealed that 2-(2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy)-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one (rac-10) exhibited a very high affinity toward all three types of opioid receptors with the highest being observed for κ-OR. Therefore, in the next step of computational investigations, a direct comparison of the absolute free binding energies [ΔGcalc (kcal/mol)] of the complexes’ formation between the respective ORs and both enantiomers of the selected candidate (S)-(+)-10 and (R)-(–)-10 as well as dextromoramide parent molecule and the series of the model opioids, including morphine, fentanyl, β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA), JDTic, and biphalin, was performed (Figure 2).

After a detailed examination of the molecular docking results, it was clear that the newly designed analog (R)-(–)-10 outperformed most of the well-known clinical drugs, except JDTic and biphalin, in terms of the mutual ligand-protein affinity to κ-OR (ΔGcalc = −8.8 kcal/mol). When considering the binding affinity toward δ-OR, docking studies showed that (R)-(–)-10 was superior to dextromoramide, morphine, and fentanyl. In turn, (R)-(–)-10 exhibited almost an identical affinity for µ-type opioid receptors as dextromoramide; however, it seemed to be significantly less potent toward µ-OR when compared with the remaining opioids except for morphine. It is noteworthy that the absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon atom presented in chiral ligand 10 is likely to display a critical role in the pharmacological activity since docking calculations confirmed that the opposite (S)-enantiomer was less efficient in binding with all the studied ORs (ΔGcalc = from −7.6 to −7.8 kcal/mol). This phenomenon could be attributed to steric clashes of the bulky diphenyl substituent and fewer hydrogen bonds formed between (S)-(+)-10 within the receptor molecules (not shown herein).

In the next step of in silico studies, the visualization of the representative energetically favorable ligand (R)-(–)-10 binding modes to all three examined ORs, with close contact with amino acid residues located in the ligand-binding pocket, was analyzed (Figure 3).

The inspection of the productive poses of (R)-(–)-10 in µ-OR showed that the ligand possesses close polar contacts between the carbonyl group and/or ethereal oxygen atom and the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr148 (Figure 3A). In turn, diphenyl substituent forms hydrophobic sets of interactions with Trp393, Val300, and Lys233, respectively. In the case of the complex of (R)-(–)-10 with δ-OR the key H-bonding was found between ethereal oxygen and a carboxylic moiety of Asp128 and nitrogen atom of morpholine moiety and Tyr129 (Figure 3B). In addition, the computational analysis revealed that diphenyl functionality of the ligand (R)-(–)-10 displayed π-stacking interaction with Trp274. Noteworthy is an extensive hydrogen bond network formed between (R)-(–)-10 and κ-OR (Figure 3C), which mainly stabilizes the potential complex more efficiently than in the cases of µ-OR and δ-OR. In this context, the critical polar contact occurred inter the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group present in (R)-(–)-10 and the amide group of Gln115, whereas ethereal oxygen interacted with the phenolic hydroxyl group of the Tyr312 side chain. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of the morpholine ring and the carboxylic acid group of Asp138 was found. Finally, the oxygen atom of the morpholine ring formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr320 and/or Thr111. All these hydrogen-bonding interactions are in the range of 1.9–2.2 Å. The most reliable binding mode identified for (R)-(–)-10 with κ-OR shows that the diphenyl scaffold was involved in a π-stacking interaction with Trp124 and stabilized by hydrophobic Leu135 and Val134 residues.

It is worth noting that in the case of the complex formed between (R)-(–)-10 and κ-type opioid receptor, the number of hydrogen bonds was 3-fold higher than for the rest of the analyzed complexes. Moreover, incorporating the ethereal oxygen into the designed analog molecule resulted in the formation of additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with each of the studied receptors, which consequently increased the affinity of (R)-(–)-10 toward ORs when compared to a dextromoramide parent molecule. These original binding modes could be useful in rationalizing the analgesic potency of the designed derivative in its high affinity and selective interactions with all three types of opioid receptors. Nevertheless, further detailed biological studies, including biochemical (protein) assays, are required to verify this hypothesis.

2.2. Synthesis of the Racemic Compounds rac-3 and rac-4a–c

Herein, the development of a novel multi-gram scale enzyme-catalyzed procedure for the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol (rac-3) using commercially available immobilized lipases type B from Candida antarctica (CAL-B) or Burkholderia cepacia (BCL) as the biocatalysts is presented. The critical enzymatic process provided sufficient amounts of each highly enantiomerically enriched alcohols (S)-(+)-3 (>99% ee) and (R)-(–)-3 (98% ee, after further hydrolysis), which were subsequently used as chiral precursors for the synthesis of both enantiomers of titled optically active ethereal analog of iso-moramide (R)-(–)-10 and (S)-(+)-10 (Scheme 1).

In the first step, racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol (rac-3) was synthesized by adopting the procedure reported by Azizi et al. [44] In this regard, treatment of 1,2-propylene oxide 2 with 1.2 equiv of morpholine 1 in water at room temperature resulted in the formation of respective β-amino alcohol rac-3. Under mild reaction conditions, the ring-opening aminolysis of initial epoxide 2 proceeded with excellent regioselectivity and >99% conv., according to gas chromatography (GC) and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. However, after conventional extractive work-up and subsequent column chromatography purification procedure, the morpholine-alcohol rac-3 was isolated in 68% yield. Mass loss of the desired rac-3, and thus reduction of the reaction yield, might be due to the partial solubility of the product in water.

In turn, to obtain racemic acyl derivatives rac-4a–c requested for analytical purposes, the β-morpholino-alcohol rac-3 was esterified with acetic anhydride (in the case of rac-4a) or the corresponding acyl chloride (in the case of rac-4b–c) dissolved in dry dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N) as a base and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). All esters were obtained in moderate-to-high yields (42–82%) after preparative column chromatography.

2.3. Lipase-Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of rac-3 Using Transesterification Methodology

The outcome of the enzymatic kinetic resolution (EKR) of racemic alcohols realized via the transesterification scenario strongly depends on the applied reactions’ conditions. In this case, optimizing the appropriate EKR parameters is a tedious task since it requires a selection of the enzyme biocatalyst and the reaction medium (so-called “medium engineering”), evaluation of the type of acyl group donor, determination of the reaction stoichiometry, setting of time of the process, adjusting operating temperature, etc. The biocatalytic studies presented herein aimed to establish optimal conditions for enantioselective transesterification of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol (rac-3) carried out using activated vinyl esters as irreversible acyl donors under kinetically controlled conditions in organic solvents. This task was achieved in a three-step optimization procedure, employing (i) enzyme selection, (ii) solvent screening, and (iii) investigation of the effect of various acyl donors. Next, under the optimal reaction conditions, the process was scaled up to 10 g of the racemic substrate rac-3, providing sufficient amounts of desired enantiomers (S)-(+)-3 and (R)-(–)-3 (obtained after hydrolysis of the acetate (R)-(–)-4a) for the synthesis of titled active agent in both stereogenic forms (S)-(+)-10 and (R)-(–)-10.

Initial analytical-scale studies were performed to find the most suitable enzyme catalyst for enantioselective transesterification of racemic alcohol rac-3. In the preliminary screening, eight commonly used commercially available lipase preparations were tested in 20% w/w with respect to substrate rac-3 and in the presence of an excess of vinyl acetate as an irreversible acyl donor in methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at 25 °C (Table 1).

a Conditions: rac-3 100 mg, lipase 20 mg, MTBE 1 mL, vinyl acetate 948 mg (16 equiv), 25 °C, 500 rpm; b Determined by GC analysis using a calibration curve; c Determined by HPLC analysis using a chiral stationary phase; d Determined by chiral HPLC analysis of the corresponding alcohol (R)-(–)-3 obtained after NaOH-catalyzed methanolysis of (R)-(–)-4a; e Calculated according to Chen et al. [45], using the equation: E = {ln[(1 − conv.)(1 − ees)]}/{ln[(1 − conv.)(1 + ees)]}.

All the reactions’ progress was monitored using GC. In turn, the evaluation of enantiomeric excesses (% ee) of EKR products was examined using HPLC equipped with columns packed with chiral stationary phases. It is important to note that for the optically active acetate (R)-(–)-4a, direct HPLC analysis was impossible since enantiomers of this compound were inseparable using various tested cellulose- and/or amylose-based chiral columns. Therefore, to determine the optical purity of (R)-(–)-4a, enantiomerically enriched acetate had to be hydrolyzed under base methanolysis conditions, and only then the resulting alcohol (R)-(–)-3 was analyzed in terms of enantiomeric excess. As shown in Table 1, Amano PS-Immobead 150 was found to be the most enantioselective lipase toward rac-3 (E > 200); however, it catalyzed the resolution of the racemate with a relatively low rate (32% conv. after 120 h). Taking the stereoselectivity and catalytic activity into account, the most efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective acetylation of rac-3 appeared to be Chirazyme L-2, C-2. This lipase displayed an E-value of 31, which resulted in the isolation of enantiomerically pure alcohol (S)-(+)-3 (>99% ee) with 58% conv. after 24 h (Table 1, entry 5). The same results in terms of the enantiomeric excess for the slower-reacting enantiomer (S)-(+)-3 were obtained with Novozym 435 and Amano PS-IM (Table 1, entries 2 and 4). However, both the afore-mentioned enzymes catalyzed KR of rac-3 at a significantly lower rate reaching 55–67% conv. after 120 h. Accordingly, our attention was paid to Chirazyme L-2, C-2, and this biocatalyst was further used in the optimization procedure toward KR of rac-3.

Since the enzymatic reaction rate, stereoselectivity, and thermal stability largely depend on the reaction medium [46,47,48], optimization studies were continued to evaluate the effect of the organic solvents on Chirazyme L-2, C-2-catalyzed enantioselective transesterification of rac-3 using vinyl acetate (Table 2).

In this regard, the EKR processes were carried out in organic solvents of varying polarity values within which the racemic substrate rac-3 could form homogenous solutions at the same ratio of the reactants as in the previous step. However, to increase the economic viability of this reaction, a reduced amount (10% w/w) of the biocatalyst was employed. It is a well-known fact that decreasing the amount of biocatalyst can be responsible for a drop in the reaction rate. Indeed, such a phenomenon was observed in the case of Chirazyme L-2, C-2-catalyzed KR of rac-3 in MTBE, which had to be elongated to 72 h to achieve a comparable 57% conv. While screening the acylation of rac-3 with vinyl acetate in various co-solvent systems, we observed the following approximate rate trend: Et2O~MTBE > n-hexane > THF > CH3CN > 1,4-dioxane > tert-amyl alcohol (2-methyl-2-butanol) > acetone. Another trend order was observed for enantioselectivity: THF > MTBE ~ tert-amyl alcohol > Et2O > n-hexane > acetone > CH3CN > 1,4-dioxane. Considering the reaction rates and the values of the E-factor, it was clear that the most promising results were obtained when Chirazyme L-2, C-2 was suspended in THF or MTBE, respectively. Since MTBE is generally free from dangerous peroxides, it was chosen for further optimization studies due to safety regimes.

The nature of an acyl transfer reagent is a crucial factor in the outcome of lipase-catalyzed acylation of secondary alcohols in organic solvents. This feature mainly stems from the fact that the type of acyl donor can markedly influence the selectivity and the rate of reactions performed with lipases [49,50,51,52,53]. Therefore, the effect of acyl donor in transesterification of rac-3 was examined by carrying out the EKR processes in the presence of 2-fold molar excess of three different vinyl esters for 16 h at 25 °C (Table 3). In all cases, the enzyme amount was increased to 20% (w/w) in ratio to rac-3, which considerably enhanced the reaction rate, thus allowing to achieve similar conversions as in the previous step.

Undertaken comparative studies with the employed vinyl esters revealed that enantioselectivity of Chirazyme L-2, C-2-catalyzed transesterification of rac-3 varied negligible (ΔE < 13). For comparable conversions (ca. 55%), the highest value of enantioselectivity factor (E = 59) was observed when vinyl butanoate was employed as the acyl donor (Table 3, entry 2). The barely marked superiority of vinyl butyrate excluded its use as an acyl donor in KR of rac-3 since this reagent is relatively expensive compared to vinyl acetate. Moreover, vinyl butyrate is a significantly less volatile compound {bp 116 °C (760 Torr) [54]} than vinyl acetate {bp 73 °C (760 Torr) [55]}, and after completion of the enzymatic reaction, its excess usually hampers the purification process. The features mentioned above show that vinyl acetate seemed to be more suitable for KR of rac-3. In turn, it is noteworthy that when acyl donor was used in a lower molar excess than before (2 equiv instead of 16 equiv), the enantioselectivity factor (E) slightly increased from 35 to 49.

The integration of the results obtained from the optimization studies revealed that the most efficient biocatalyst was Chirazyme L-2, C-2 when used at 20 mg/mL conc. and suspended in a solution of rac-3 (100 mg/mL conc.) in a mixture of vinyl acetate (2 equiv) and MTBE (1 mL/0.69 mmol of rac-3) as the co-solvent. In the next step, to show the robustness of the developed methodology, the biotransformation of rac-3 was scaled up to multi-gram amounts of the racemic substrate (Table 4).

At first, Chirazyme L-2, C-2-catalyzed transesterification of rac-3 was carried out at 1 g-scale of the substrate. Termination of the EKR process after 16 h furnished slower-reacting enantiomer (S)-(+)-3 in 34% yield with >99% ee and the formed optically active acetate (R)-(–)-4a in 40% yield with 75% ee and 57% conversion. This result showed that the linear enlargement of EKR parameters was prone to scalability. In turn, to obtain antipode (R)-(–)-3 with higher enantiomeric purity, the preparative-scale EKR of rac-3 was carried out using Amano PS-Immobead 150 as the biocatalysts, which showed ultra-selectivity toward the formation of homochiral (R)-(–)-4a from the racemic mixture. Arresting the reaction after 144 h (ca. 33% conv.) afforded (S)-(+)-3 in 62% yield with 49% ee and (R)-(–)-4a in 28% yield with 99% ee, respectively. Next, optically active ester (R)-(–)-4a was hydrolyzed into the corresponding alcohol (R)-(–)-3 isolated in 66% yield with 98% ee. In addition, the preparative EKR was performed using 10 g of rac-3, which resulted in the isolation of (S)-(+)-3 in 36% yield with >99% ee and (R)-(–)-4a in 38% yield with 79% ee. In this case, to achieve comparable conversion (56%), the reaction had to be elongated to 27 h. A drop in the reaction rate might be attributed to mass transfer limitations, which constitute a typical drawback for the processes conducted in a batch mode. However, further optimization was discontinued as it was far beyond the scope of this study.

2.4. Determination of the Absolute Configuration of (S)-(+)-3

Although the preparation of optically active alcohol (S)-(+)-3 has already been reported via the reduction of the corresponding lactamide derived from ethyl (2S)-lactate with borane-methyl sulfide [56], clear proof of its absolute configuration has not been provided yet. Furthermore, the lack of literature data concerning a specific rotation sign of the enzymatic KR products prevented the unambiguous classification of the stereochemistry of non-racemic morpholino-alcohol derivatives. Therefore, the assignment of the absolute configuration of (S)-(+)-3 was determined through a combination of synthetic transformations and spectroscopic studies by following the so-called Mosher’s methodology modified by Riguera et al. [57]. In this regard, enantiomerically pure alcohol of undefined stereochemistry (?)-(+)-3 (>99% ee) was esterified in two separate experiments with both enantiomers of α-methoxy-α-phenylacetic acid (MPA) as the chiral derivatizing agents (CDAs) (Scheme 2).

In practice, the double derivatization procedure employing CDAs assumes the formation of two diastereomers (in this case: (2S)-1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-yl (2R)-methoxy(phenyl)acetate ((S)-(+)-3-(R)-MPA) and (2S)-1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-yl (2S)-methoxy(phenyl)acetate ((S)-(+)-3-(S)-MPA) in which NMR chemical shifts of the protons present in functional groups directly attached to the stereogenic center of alcoholic (+)-3 fragment should be different as a result of the shielding effect of the phenyl substituent of chiral CDA. This observation stems from the anisotropic effect of the π-electron-rich benzene ring. Another key feature of this experimental model is that the most stable conformer among the MPA esters of mono-functional secondary alcohols, by a value of 0.6–1.0 kcal/mol, is the sp conformer [58]. It means that the methoxy group, the Cα carbon, and the carbonyl group of the MPA unit, as well as the methine proton of the alcohol part, are in the same plane with the methoxy and the carbonyl groups in a syn-periplanar disposition.

To determine the stereochemistry of a chiral carbon atom of (+)-3, sequential experimental-theoretical operations were made: (i) spectra for both MPA-esters (S)-(+)-3-(R)-MPA and (S)-(+)-3-(S)-MPA were recorded (Figure 4), (ii) proton NMR signals of both afore-mentioned species were assigned, (iii) the differences between the chemical shifts of the signals for a certain proton of the two synthesized derivatives (expressed as ΔδRS) were calculated.

The comparison of the spectra obtained from (S)-(+)-3-(R)-MPA and (S)-(+)-3-(S)-MPA, as well as considering a greater representative population of the sp conformer, led to the following observations: (i) the benzene ring of the chiral auxiliary projects its magnetic anisotropy more strongly toward methyl group protons H(1’) in the (R)-MPA derivative (S)-(+)-3-(R)-MPA, while the same group of protons in the corresponding (S)-MPA ester (S)-(+)-3-(S)-MPA remains unaffected; (ii) the opposite phenomenon is observed for methylene protons H(2’), which are shielded in (S)-(+)-3-(S)-MPA due to the direction of anisotropic effect of the phenyl moiety, while in (S)-(+)-3-(R)-MPA they are unaffected.

From the findings mentioned above and the sign distributions of the equations presented in Figure 5, the (S)-configuration of the examined alcohol (+)-3 is apparent. In this context, the results of NMR experiments proved that a simple and low-cost modified form of Mosher’s methodology could provide a reliable determination of the absolute configuration of non-racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol (3). This indirect analytical tool is incredibly precious in the case of liquid or oil compounds, toward which the application of unambiguous absolute stereochemistry assignment methods, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, are unavailable due to lack of the appropriate monocrystals.

2.5. Synthesis of Optically Active Ethereal Analog of iso-Moramide (S)-(+)-10 and (R)-(–)-10

Continuing the planned synthesis of potential analgesics, a commercially available diphenylacetic acid (7) was transformed into corresponding acid chloride 8 by means of 15 equiv of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) in boiling benzene. Subsequently, 8 was reacted with 3.1 equiv of pyrrolidine in 1,4-dioxane to afford the respective amide 10 in 82% yield after two steps. Next, the afore-prepared optically active morpholino-alcohols (S)-(+)-3 (>99% ee) and (R)-(–)-3 (98% ee) were subjected to chlorination using SOCl2 in chloroform (CHCl3). It is worth noting that this approach resulted in the formation of the respective 4-(2-chloropropyl)morpholine enantiomers (R)-(–)-5 (>99% ee) and (S)-(+)-5 (98% ee) in high 69–71% yield range, and with complete inversion of the stereochemical configuration, even though the reactions were carried out without additional hydrogen chloride acceptor (i.e., pyridine, triethylamine). The observed total stereoinversion might be attributed to the fact that the in situ formed HCl was effectively trapped by the nitrogen atom of the morpholine ring, thus preventing the racemization of the chiral alcohols (S)-(+)-3 or (R)-(–)-3 as a result of SN1-type reaction. In order to confirm the SN2 mechanism of the reaction with sole SOCl2, the additional (alternative) SN2-type chlorination of (S)-(+)-3 using tetrachloromethane (CCl4) and triphenylphosphine (Ph3P) under Appel reaction conditions was performed. In this case, the desired chloride (R)-(–)-5 was isolated in a 57% yield without racemization (>99% ee). The optical purity of both enantiomeric forms of chloro-derivative (R)-(–)-5 and (S)-(+)-5 was assessed with chiral HPLC after derivatization of the halogen moiety with 10 equiv of thiophenol (PhSH) under basic conditions (EtONa/EtOH) (for details, see Experimental Section 3.13).

With both enantiomers of 4-(2-chloropropyl)morpholine ((R)-(–)-5 and (S)-(+)-5) in hand, we subsequently proceeded to the last step of the synthesis of target molecules (S)-(+)-10 and (R)-(–)-10. In order to form an ethereal connection between N-diphenylacetyl-1-pyrrolidine (9) and 4-(2-chloropropyl)morpholine (5), and thus obtain desired chiral product 10, at first, a tertiary α-hydroxycarbonyl compound had to be prepared from 9. In general, a chemo- and regioselective α-hydroxylation of carbonyl compounds possessing diphenylacetyl moiety is a desirable synthetic task since many antimuscarinic and/or anticholinergic pharmaceuticals can be synthesized from that building block (Figure 6).

Recently, two groundbreaking synthetic methods, including transition-metal-catalyzed C–H hydroxylation using a dinuclear Pd(II) complex as an oxygen transfer catalyst [59] and/or a transition-metal-free Cs2CO3/P(OEt)3/O2 reaction system [60], have been developed. Nevertheless, both these methods possess significant limitations. The first mentioned protocol employs an expensive and difficult-to-obtain Pd-catalyst, which complete removal from the product is a very laborious task, thus excluding it from industrial application, particularly drug synthesis. In turn, the second approach suffers from triethyl phosphite (P(OEt)3), a flammable and malodorous liquid that complicates the handling and utilization of contaminants.

Therefore, we have explored an alternative procedure using a mixture of O2-saturated NaOH/DMSO in the presence of N-benzyl-N,N,N-triethylammonium chloride (TEBA(Cl)) as the phase transfer catalyst. Moreover, a huge 8-fold molar excess of NaOH with respect to carbonyl substrate 9 allowed the subsequent etherification of the in situ formed α-hydroxyl derivative with 1.3 equiv of (R)-(–)-5 (>99% ee) under relatively mild reaction conditions. In this regard, a “one-pot” α-hydroxylation/etherification transformation of 9 was carried out at 40 °C for 4 h, furnishing (R)-(–)-10 in 31% yield with 89% ee. After employing the same reaction conditions toward (S)-(–)-5 (98% ee), the respective counterpart (S)-(+)-10 was isolated in 20% yield with 87% ee.

It seems rational that the studied reaction follows a base-catalyzed auto-oxidation mechanism proposed by Russell et al. [61,62]. Following this hypothesis, the overall α-hydroxylation/etherification process might be presented by the respective reaction sequence as depicted in Scheme 3. At first, (i) substrate 9 is deprotonated by sodium hydroxide/dimethyl sulfoxide (NaOH/DMSO) superbase, and (ii) the resulting carbanion is rapidly oxygenated by molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant to give the corresponding peroxide. In turn, the superoxide (iii) is further reduced by DMSO to the corresponding alcohol, followed by (iv and v) a regioselective ring-opening of the in situ formed aziridinium ion, leading to the formation of desired (R)-(–)-10. A relatively low reaction yield might be attributed to chemo- and regio-selectivity issues, resulting from a “double-reactivity” of the employed alkylating agent 5. This phenomenon stems from a spontaneous intramolecular cyclization of (R)-(–)-5 into a highly reactive aziridinium ion, which is most probably consumed in the unproductive side reactions. In this context, it appeared that the etherification reaction proceeds not only via a regioselective ring-opening of the aziridinium species but also (vi) through a direct nucleophilic displacement of the chloride ion present in non-racemic 5 as is observed in the case of convenient dextromoramide synthesis. Both these concurrent processes provide a complex mixture of isomeric products with reversed stereochemistry at the corresponding asymmetric carbon atoms, which complicate the isolation and purification of non-racemic derivative 10.

The purity and identity of isolated 2-[(2R)-2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one ((R)-(–)-10) was confirmed by using complementary analytical methods including 1H and 13C NMR, DEPT-135, 2D NMR (HSQC), FT-IR, ESI-MS, GC-MS, and HPLC (for details, see the Supplementary Materials).

The chemical structure and absolute configuration of (R)-(–)-10 were unambiguously confirmed by solving the crystal structure from monocrystals by using X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 7). For details concerning the crystal growth conditions and routine crystal structure determination using XRD analysis, please see Experimental Section 3.18.

3.1. Molecular Docking

Molecular docking calculations were performed with AutoDock Vina v. 1.1.2. program (https://vina.scripps.edu/, accessed on 5 September 2022) [43] using the standard docking protocol described in our recent studies [65,66]. All ligands were prepared with ChemAxon MarvinSketch v. 14.9.1.0 (https://chemaxon.com/marvin, accessed on 5 September 2022), optimized in terms of geometry in Avogadro v. 1.2.0. (https://avogadro.cc/, accessed on 5 September 2022), and saved as .mol2 files. Macromolecule target crystal structures, including µ-type opioid receptor (µ-OR; PDB ID: 4DKL [40], 2.80 Å resolution), δ-type opioid receptor (δ-OR; PDB ID: 4EJ4 [41], 3.40 Å resolution), and κ-type opioid receptor (κ-OR; PDB ID: 4DJH [42], 2.90 Å resolution), were taken from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/, accessed on 5 September 2022). All non-protein molecules (i.e., ligands and crystal waters) were removed, the polar hydrogens were then added, and Gesteiger charges were calculated using AutoDock tools v. 1.5.6. to get the appropriate file in .pdbqt format. Next, AutoGrid was used to find an appropriate grid box size in terms of x, y, z coordinates with the final size space dimension set as follows: x = 60 Å, y = 60 Å, z = 60 Å, and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. Dockings were performed with an exhaustiveness level of 48 concerning global search. For each ligand molecule, 100 independent runs were performed using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (GA) with at most 106 energy evaluations and a maximum number of generations of >27,000 Å3 (the search space volume). The rest of the docking parameters, including the remaining Lamarckian GA parameters, were set as default using the standard values for genetic Vina algorithms (the posed dockings were below 5.00 Å rmsd). The docking modes of each ligand were clustered and ranked based on a mutual ligand-protein affinity expressed as absolute free binding energies (ΔGcalc (kcal/mol)) as well as the rmsd-values in both modes regarding rmsd lower bound (l.b.) and rmsd upper bound (u.b.), respectively. The receptor-ligand interactions were visualized using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System software v. 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC (https://pymol.org/2/, accessed on 5 September 2022). The validation of the docking protocol was achieved by ensuring that the database ligands (i.e., methyl 4-{[(5β,6α)-17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-epoxymorphinan-6-yl]amino}-4-oxobutanoate (BFO, in the case of 4DKL), (4bS,8R,8aS,14bR)-7-(cyclopropylmethyl)-5,6,7,8,14,14b-hexahydro-4,8-methano [1]benzofuro [2,3-a]pyrido [4,3-b]carbazole-1,8a(9H)-diol (naltrindole, in the case of 4EJ4), and (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-{(2S)-1-[(3R,4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl]-3-methylbutan-2-yl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (JDTic, in the case of 4DJH)) could be re-docked to the respective OR under the established parameters, resulting in the same accommodation as in the co-crystallized complexes.

3.17. General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2-[(2R)-2-(Morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one ((R)-(–)-10) and 2-[(2S)-2-(Morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one ((S)-(+)-10)

To a solution of N-diphenylacetyl-1-pyrrolidine (9, 500 mg, 1.88 mmol) and N-benzyl-N,N,N-triethylammonium chloride (TEBA(Cl), 42 mg, 0.19 mmol) in dry DMSO (8 mL), a grounded NaOH (603 mg; 15.07 mmol) was added in gentle flow of molecular O2. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min, and then a solution of chloro-derivative (R)-(–)-5 (400 mg, 2.45 mmol, >99% ee) in dry DMSO (2 mL) was added in one portion, and the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously with a mechanical stirrer for additional 4 h at 40 °C under oxygen provided from a balloon. The reaction was stopped by the addition of H2O (20 mL). After extraction of an aqueous phase with Et2O (6 × 30 mL), the combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, the drying agent was filtered off, and the excess solvent was removed under reduced pressure affording the crude product, which was subsequently purified by PLC using a gradient of n-hexane/acetone (30:10, 15:10, v/v). The appropriate fraction was removed, placed in the round-bottomed flask, suspended in the mixture of n-hexane/acetone (150 mL, 10:20, v/v), and vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the silica gel was filtered off, washed with portions of n-hexane/acetone (2 × 50 mL, 1:1, v/v), and the permeate was concentrated under reduced pressure resulting in a yellowish semi-solid, which was subsequently dissolved in warm EtOAc (1 mL) and after careful addition of n-hexane (0.5 mL) was kept in the fridge for 2 days to afford (R)-(–)-10 (230 mg, 31% yield, 89% ee, [α]D22 = –22.6 (c 1.9, CHCl3)) as colorless crystals. The synthesis of optically active (S)-(+)-10 (150 mg, 20% yield, 87% ee, [α]D22 = +19.2 (c 1.8, CHCl3)) was carried out essentially by the same route using or (S)-(+)-5 (98% ee) as an alkylating agent.

3.18.1. Conditions for Crystal Growth of 2-[(2R)-2-(Morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one ((R)-(–)-10)

Colorless single crystal of sufficient quality for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was prepared using standard vapor diffusion methodology. In this regard, (R)-(–)-10 (15 mg, 89% ee) was dissolved in EtOAc (1 mL) and transferred into an open-neck glass vial (V = 4mL) opened and placed in a bottle that contained n-hexane. The outer vessel was sealed, and the composed system was stored at room temperature for 10 days until monocrystals were grown.

3.18.2. Crystal Structure Determination of (R)-(–)-10

A colorless single crystal of (R)-(–)-10 (0.67 × 0.42 × 0.25 mm3), suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, was selected under the polarizing microscope, mounted in an inert oil, and transferred to the cold gas stream of the Oxford Diffraction κ-CCD Gemini A Ultra diffractometer. Diffraction data were collected at 100.0(1) K with mirror monochromated CuKα radiation. Cell refinement and data collection, as well as data reduction and analysis, were performed with the Crysalispro software [69]. The absolute-structure of (R)-(–)-10 was solved with the Olex2 [70] using the ShelXT [71] structure solution program (Intrinsic Phasing) and refined with the SHELXL-2018/3 [72] refinement package (Least Squares minimization). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were added to the structure model at geometrically idealized coordinates and refined as riding atoms with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(CH and CH2) or Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(CH3). The absolute configuration for the compound molecule (R) was successfully determined using anomalous dispersion effects. Flack parameter [73] calculated from 3549 selected quotients (Parsons’ method) [74] equals 0.03(3). Further analysis of the absolute structure assignment was performed using likelihood methods with PLATON [75]. A total of 3677 Bijvoet pairs (coverage of 1.00) were included in the calculations. The resulting value of the Hooft parameter [76] was 0.02(6), with a P3 probability for an inverted structure smaller than 1 × 10−60. These results indicated that the absolute-structure has been correctly assigned.

4. Conclusions

The principal aim of the present work was to design and synthesize a novel potent analog of iso-moramide utilizing molecular docking calculations and a chemoenzymatic methodology. Initial docking studies revealed that the ethereal analog of (R)-iso-moramide, namely 2-[(2R)-2-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]-2,2-diphenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one, exhibits substantial affinity toward all three opioid receptors (ORs), with the highest selectivity calculated for κ-OR. Based on in silico investigations, it is most likely that the newly designed dextromoramide analog might exhibit reduced side effects and increased analgesic activity compared to the original drug, and therefore, elaboration of its synthesis seemed to be rational. In this regard, a chemoenzymatic synthesis of both enantiomeric forms of a novel ethereal analog of iso-moramide, exhibiting potentially high analgesic activity, was developed using classical lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol as a key step. Optimization studies on the enantioselective transesterification of the afore-mentioned racemate revealed that immobilized lipases isolated from Candida antarctica type B (Chirazyme L-2, C-2) and Burkholderia cepacia (Amano PS-Immobead 150) were the most efficient biocatalysts. The employment of the selected enzymes and appropriate conditions allowed to accomplish a multi-gram scale KR with enantiomerically pure products being obtained–(S)-morpholino-alcohol (>99% ee) and the respective (R)-acetate (99% ee). The stereochemical preference of the lipase preparations in the transesterification reaction of racemic 1-(morpholin-4-yl)propan-2-ol was determined by the absolute configuration assignment using a modified form of Mosher’s methodology. After comparing 1H NMR spectra recorded for diastereomeric esters prepared from the respective chiral auxiliaries, the (S)-configuration was assigned to the slower-reacting enantiomer of morpholino-alcohol. The results of the spectroscopic experiments confirmed that all the employed lipases behaved as typical Kazlauskas-type catalysts [77]. The biocatalytic step was followed by convenient NaOH-mediated hydrolysis of the (R)-acetate leading to (R)-morpholino-alcohol (98% ee) and the subsequent chlorination of both chiral antipodes of hydroxyl-derivatives using SOCl2. Further chemical transformations of optically active chlorides employing N-diphenylacetyl-1-pyrrolidine under PTC-assisted conditions with the use of TEBA(Cl) as the phase-transfer catalyst and the liquid–solid system comprising grounded NaOH suspended in O2-saturated DMSO as an oxidation agent resulted in the preparation of (R)-iso-moramide-ether in 31% yield and 89% ee from (R)-chloride (>99% ee), and (S)-iso-moramide-ether in 20% yield and 87% ee from (S)-chloride (98% ee), respectively. Based on the literature, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed for a “one-pot” α-hydroxylation/etherification reaction indicating as this transformation partially follows the Russell mechanism concerning the oxidation of di-benzylic carbonation and subsequent DMSO-mediated reduction of the generated peroxide followed by regioselective ring-opening of the in situ formed aziridinium ion by α-hydroxylated N-diphenylacetyl-1-pyrrolidine. The suitable monocrystals of the synthesized active agent were obtained by slow evaporation/precipitation from a solution using a standard diffusion methodology, and their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Further in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of this compound is required.
